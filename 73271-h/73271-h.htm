<h3>
Foreword
</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> work of editing the Bounds Spiritual
Life Books (of which the present volume is
the sixth) has been a labour of love which
has brought great profit and blessing to my own
soul. After years of close study of the literary
remains of this great Christian, together with the
work of other mystics, I am fully persuaded that
to but few of the sons of men has there been given
such spiritual power as was vouchsafed to Edward
McKendree Bounds. Truly he was a burning and
a shining light, and as <cite>The Sunday School Times</cite>
says, “he was a specialist in prayer and his books
are for the quiet hour, for careful meditation and
for all who wish to seek and find the treasures
of God.”</p>

<p>It was my great privilege to know the author
well, and also to know that his intention, in everything
he wrote, was for the salvation of his readers.
<cite>The Essentials of Prayer</cite> is sent forth in this
spirit. May God bless it to many hearts and use it
for the upbuilding and strengthening of Christian
character through the length and breadth of the
land.</p>

<h4>PRAYER TAKES IN THE WHOLE MAN
</h4>
</div><!--end chapter header-->

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Henry Clay Trumbull spoke forth the Infinite in the
terms of our world, and the Eternal in the forms of our
human life. Some years ago, on a ferry-boat, I met a gentleman
who knew him, and I told him that when I had last seen
Dr. Trumbull, a fortnight before, he had spoken of him.
‘Oh, yes,’ said my friend, ‘he was a great Christian, so real,
so intense. He was at my home years ago and we were talking
about prayer.” “Why, Trumbull,” I said, “you don’t
mean to say if you lost a pencil you would pray about it,
and ask God to help you find it.” “Of course I would; of
course I would,” was his instant and excited reply.’ Of
course he would. Was not his faith a real thing? Like the
Saviour, he put his doctrine strongly by taking an extreme
illustration to embody his principle, but the principle was
fundamental. He did trust God in everything. And the
Father honoured the trust of His child.”—<span class="smcap">Robert E. Speer.</span></p>
</div><!--end blockquote-->

<p class="p2 drop-cap">P<span class="smcap">rayer</span> has to do with the entire man.
Prayer takes in man in his whole being,
mind, soul and body. It takes the whole
man to pray, and prayer affects the entire man in
its gracious results. As the whole nature of man
enters into prayer, so also all that belongs to man
is the beneficiary of prayer. All of man receives
benefits in prayer. The whole man must be given
to God in praying. The largest results in praying
come to him who gives himself, all of himself, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
that belongs to himself, to God. This is the secret
of full consecration, and this is a condition of successful
praying, and the sort of praying which
brings the largest fruits.</p>

<p>The men of olden times who wrought well in
prayer, who brought the largest things to pass, who
moved God to do great things, were those who were
entirely given over to God in their praying. God
wants, and must have, all that there is in man in
answering his prayers. He must have whole-hearted
men through whom to work out His purposes
and plans concerning men. God must have
men in their entirety. No double-minded man need
apply. No vacillating man can be used. No man
with a divided allegiance to God, and the world and
self, can do the praying that is needed.</p>

<p>Holiness is wholeness, and so God wants holy
men, men whole-hearted and true, for His service
and for the work of praying. “And the very God
of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your
whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless
unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”
These are the sort of men God wants for leaders
of the hosts of Israel, and these are the kind out of
which the praying class is formed.</p>

<p>Man is a trinity in one, and yet man is neither a
trinity nor a dual creature when he prays, but a
unit. Man is one in all the essentials and acts and
attitudes of piety. Soul, spirit and body are to
unite in all things pertaining to life and godliness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
The body, first of all, engages in prayer, since it
assumes the praying attitude in prayer. Prostration
of the body becomes us in praying as well as
prostration of the soul. The attitude of the body
counts much in prayer, although it is true that the
heart may be haughty and lifted up, and the mind
listless and wandering, and the praying a mere
form, even while the knees are bent in prayer.</p>

<p>Daniel kneeled upon his knees three times a day
in prayer. Solomon kneeled in prayer at the dedication
of the temple. Our Lord in Gethsemane prostrated
Himself in that memorable season of praying
just before His betrayal. Where there is earnest
and faithful praying the body always takes on the
form most suited to the state of the soul at the
time. The body, that far, joins the soul in praying.</p>

<p>The entire man must pray. The whole man, life,
heart, temper, mind, are in it. Each and all join in
the prayer exercise. Doubt, double-mindedness,
division of the affections, are all foreign to the
closet. Character and conduct, undefiled, made
whiter than snow, are mighty potencies, and are
the most seemly beauties for the closet hour, and
for the struggles of prayer.</p>

<p>A loyal intellect must conspire and add the energy
and fire of its undoubting and undivided faith
to that kind of an hour, the hour of prayer.
Necessarily the mind enters into the praying. First
of all, it takes thought to pray. The intellect
teaches us we ought to pray. By serious thinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
beforehand the mind prepares itself for approaching
a throne of grace. Thought goes before entrance
into the closet and prepares the way for true
praying. It considers what will be asked for in the
closet hour. True praying does not leave to the
inspiration of the hour what will be the requests of
that hour. As praying is asking for something
definite of God, so, beforehand, the thought arises—“What
shall I ask for at this hour?” All vain
and evil and frivolous thoughts are eliminated, and
the mind is given over entirely to God, thinking of
Him, of what is needed, and what has been received
in the past. By every token, prayer, in taking hold
of the entire man, does not leave out the mind.
The very first step in prayer is a mental one. The
disciples took that first step when they said unto
Jesus at one time, “Lord, teach us to pray.” We
must be taught through the intellect, and just in
so far as the intellect is given up to God in prayer,
will we be able to learn well and readily the lesson
of prayer.</p>

<p>Paul spreads the nature of prayer over the whole
man. It must be so. It takes the whole man to
embrace in its god-like sympathies the entire race
of man—the sorrows, the sins and the death of
Adam’s fallen race. It takes the whole man to run
parallel with God’s high and sublime will in saving
mankind. It takes the whole man to stand with our
Lord Jesus Christ as the one Mediator between God
and sinful man. This is the doctrine Paul teaches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
in his prayer-directory in the second chapter of his
first Epistle to Timothy.</p>

<p>Nowhere does it appear so clearly that it requires
the entire man in all departments of his being, to
pray than in this teaching of Paul. It takes the
whole man to pray till all the storms which agitate
his soul are calmed to a great calm, till the stormy
winds and waves cease as by a Godlike spell. It
takes the whole man to pray till cruel tyrants and
unjust rulers are changed in their natures and lives,
as well as in their governing qualities, or till they
cease to rule. It requires the entire man in praying
till high and proud and unspiritual ecclesiastics become
gentle, lowly and religious, till godliness and
gravity bear rule in Church and in State, in home
and in business, in public as well as in private life.</p>

<p>It is man’s business to pray; and it takes manly
men to do it. It is godly business to pray and it
takes godly men to do it. And it is godly men who
give over themselves entirely to prayer. Prayer is
far-reaching in its influence and in its gracious effects.
It is intense and profound business which
deals with God and His plans and purposes, and it
takes whole-hearted men to do it. No half-hearted,
half-brained, half-spirited effort will do for this
serious, all-important, heavenly business. The
whole heart, the whole brain, the whole spirit,
must be in the matter of praying, which is so
mightily to affect the characters and destinies
of men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>The answer of Jesus to the scribe as to what was
the first and greatest commandment was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The Lord our God is one Lord; And thou shalt
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with
all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy
strength.”</p>
</div>

<p>In one word, the entire man without reservation
must love God. So it takes the same entire man to
do the praying which God requires of men. All the
powers of man must be engaged in it. God cannot
tolerate a divided heart in the love He requires of
men, neither can He bear with a divided man in
praying.</p>

<p>In the one hundred and nineteenth Psalm the
Psalmist teaches this very truth in these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and
that seek him with the whole heart.”</p>
</div>

<p>It takes whole-hearted men to keep God’s commandments
and it demands the same sort of men
to seek God. These are they who are counted
“blessed.” Upon these whole-hearted ones God’s
approval rests.</p>

<p>Bringing the case closer home to himself the
Psalmist makes this declaration as to his practice:
“With my whole heart have I sought thee; O let me
not wander from thy commandments.”</p>

<p>And further on, giving us his prayer for a wise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
and understanding heart, he tells us his purposes
concerning the keeping of God’s law:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Give me understanding and I shall keep thy law;
Yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.”</p>
</div>

<p>Just as it requires a whole heart given to God to
gladly and fully obey God’s commandments, so it
takes a whole heart to do effectual praying.</p>

<p>Because it requires the whole man to pray, praying
is no easy task. Praying is far more than
simply bending the knee and saying a few words
by rote.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“’Tis not enough to bend the knee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And words of prayer to say;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The heart must with the lips agree,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Or else we do not pray.”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Praying is no light and trifling exercise. While
children should be taught early to pray, praying is
no child’s task. Prayer draws upon the whole
nature of man. Prayer engages all the powers of
man’s moral and spiritual nature. It is this which
explains somewhat the praying of our Lord described
as in Hebrews 5:7:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered
up prayers and supplications, with strong crying and
tears, unto him that was able to save him from death,
and was heard in that he feared.”</p>
</div>

<p>It takes only a moment’s thought to see how such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
praying of our Lord drew mightily upon all the
powers of His being, and called into exercise every
part of His nature. This is the praying which
brings the soul close to God and which brings God
down to earth.</p>

<p>Body, soul and spirit are taxed and brought under
tribute to prayer. David Brainerd makes this
record of his praying:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“God enabled me to agonise in prayer till I was wet
with perspiration, though in the shade and in a cool
place.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Son of God in Gethsemane was in an agony
of prayer, which engaged His whole being:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“And when he was at the place, he said unto them,
Pray ye that ye enter not into temptation. And he
was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and
kneeled down and prayed, saying, Father, if thou be
willing, remove this cup from me; nevertheless, not
my will, but thine, be done. And there appeared an
angel unto him, from heaven, strengthening him.
And being in an agony, he prayed more earnestly:
and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood
falling down to the ground.” Luke 22:40-44.</p>
</div>

<p>Here was praying which laid its hands on every
part of our Lord’s nature, which called forth all the
powers of his soul, His mind and His body. This
was praying which took in the entire man.</p>

<p>Paul was acquainted with this kind of praying.
In writing to the Roman Christians, he urges them
to pray with him after this fashion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
<p>“Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus
Christ’s sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye
strive together with me in your prayers to God
for me.”</p>
</div>

<p>The words, “strive together with me,” tells of
Paul’s praying, and how much he put into it. It is
not a docile request, not a little thing, this sort of
praying, this “striving with me.” It is of the
nature of a great battle, a conflict to win, a great
battle to be fought. The praying Christian, as the
soldier, fights a life-and-death struggle. His honour,
his immortality, and eternal life are all in it.
This is praying as the athlete struggles for the
mastery, and for the crown, and as he wrestles or
runs a race. Everything depends on the strength
he puts in it. Energy, ardour, swiftness, every
power of his nature is in it. Every power is quickened
and strained to its very utmost. Littleness,
half-heartedness, weakness and laziness are all
absent.</p>

<p>Just as it takes the whole man to pray successfully,
so in turn the whole man receives the benefits
of such praying. As every part of man’s complex
being enters into true praying, so every part of that
same nature receives blessings from God in answer
to such praying. This kind of praying engages our
undivided hearts, our full consent to be the Lord’s,
our whole desires.</p>

<p>God sees to it that when the whole man prays, in
turn the whole man shall be blessed. His body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
takes in the good of praying, for much praying is
done specifically for the body. Food and raiment,
health and bodily vigour, come in answer to
praying. Clear mental action, right thinking, an
enlightened understanding, and safe reasoning
powers, come from praying. Divine guidance
means God so moving and impressing the mind,
that we shall make wise and safe decisions. “The
meek will he guide in judgment.”</p>

<p>Many a praying preacher has been greatly helped
just at this point. The unction of the Holy One
which comes upon the preacher invigorates the
mind, loosens up thought and gives utterance. This
is the explanation of former days when men of very
limited education had such wonderful liberty of the
Spirit in praying and in preaching. Their thoughts
flowed as a stream of water. Their entire intellectual
machinery felt the impulse of the Divine
Spirit’s gracious influences.</p>

<p>And, of course, the soul receives large benefits in
this sort of praying. Thousands can testify to this
statement. So we repeat, that as the entire man
comes into play in true, earnest effectual praying,
so the entire man, soul, mind and body, receives the
benefits of prayer.</p>

<h4>PRAYER AND HUMILITY
</h4>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“If two angels were to receive at the same moment a commission
from God, one to go down and rule earth’s grandest
empire, the other to go and sweep the streets of its meanest
village, it would be a matter of entire indifference to each
which service fell to his lot, the post of ruler or the post of
scavenger; for the joy of the angels lies only in obedience to
God’s will, and with equal joy they would lift a Lazarus in
his rags to Abraham’s bosom, or be a chariot of fire to carry
an Elijah home.”—<span class="smcap">John Newton.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="p2 drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">o</span> be humble is to have a low estimate of
one’s self. It is to be modest, lowly, with a
disposition to seek obscurity. Humility retires
itself from the public gaze. It does not seek
publicity nor hunt for high places, neither does it
care for prominence. Humility is retiring in its
nature. Self-abasement belongs to humility. It is
given to self-depreciation. It never exalts itself in
the eyes of others nor even in the eyes of itself.
Modesty is one of its most prominent characteristics.</p>

<p>In humility there is the total absence of pride,
and it is at the very farthest distance from anything
like self-conceit. There is no self-praise in
humility. Rather it has the disposition to praise
others. “In honour preferring one another.” It
is not given to self-exaltation. Humility does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
love the uppermost seats and aspire to the high
places. It is willing to take the lowliest seat and
prefers those places where it will be unnoticed.
The prayer of humility is after this fashion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“Never let the world break in,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fix a mighty gulf between;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Keep me humble and unknown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Prized and loved by God alone.”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Humility does not have its eyes on self, but
rather on God and others. It is poor in spirit,
meek in behaviour, lowly in heart. “With all lowliness
and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing
one another in love.”</p>

<p>The parable of the Pharisee and publican is a
sermon in brief on humility and self-praise. The
Pharisee, given over to self-conceit, wrapped up in
himself, seeing only his own self-righteous deeds,
catalogues his virtues before God, despising the
poor publican who stands afar off. He exalts himself,
gives himself over to self-praise, is self-centered,
and goes away unjustified, condemned
and rejected by God.</p>

<p>The publican sees no good in himself, is overwhelmed
with self-depreciation, far removed from
anything which would take any credit for any good
in himself, does not presume to lift his eyes to
heaven, but with downcast countenance smites himself
on his breast, and cries out, “God be merciful
to me, a sinner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
Our Lord with great preciseness gives us the
sequel of the story of these two men, one utterly
devoid of humility, the other utterly submerged
in the spirit of self-depreciation and lowliness of
mind.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I tell you this man went down to his house justified
rather than the other; for every one that exalteth
himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself
shall be exalted.” Luke 18:14.</p>
</div>

<p>God puts a great price on humility of heart. It
is good to be clothed with humility as with a garment.
It is written, “God resisteth the proud, but
giveth grace to the humble.” That which brings
the praying soul near to God is humility of heart.
That which gives wings to prayer is lowliness of
mind. That which gives ready access to the throne
of grace is self-depreciation. Pride, self-esteem,
and self-praise effectually shut the door of prayer.
He who would come to God must approach Him
with self hid from his eyes. He must not be
puffed-up with self-conceit, nor be possessed with
an over-estimate of his virtues and good works.</p>

<p>Humility is a rare Christian grace, of great price
in the courts of heaven, entering into and being an
inseparable condition of effectual praying. It gives
access to God when other qualities fail. It takes
many descriptions to describe it, and many definitions
to define it. It is a rare and retiring grace.
Its full portrait is found only in the Lord Jesus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
Christ. Our prayers must be set low before they
can ever rise high. Our prayers must have much
of the dust on them before they can ever have much
of the glory of the skies in them. In our Lord’s
teaching, humility has such prominence in His system
of religion, and is such a distinguishing feature
of His character, that to leave it out of His lesson
on prayer would be very unseemly, would not comport
with His character, and would not fit into His
religious system.</p>

<p>The parable of the Pharisee and publican stands
out in such bold relief that we must again refer to
it. The Pharisee seemed to be inured to prayer.
Certainly he should have known by that time how
to pray, but alas! like many others, he seemed never
to have learned this invaluable lesson. He leaves
business and business hours and walks with steady
and fixed steps up to the house of prayer. The
position and place are well-chosen by him. There
is the sacred place, the sacred hour, and the sacred
name, each and all invoked by this seemingly praying
man. But this praying ecclesiastic, though
schooled to prayer, by training and by habit, prays
not. Words are uttered by him, but words are not
prayer. God hears his words only to condemn him.
A death-chill has come from those formal lips of
prayer—a death-curse from God is on his words
of prayer. A solution of pride has entirely
poisoned the prayer offering of that hour. His
entire praying has been impregnated with self-praise,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
self-congratulation, and self-exaltation.
That season of temple going has had no worship
whatever in it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the publican, smitten with a
deep sense of his sins and his inward sinfulness,
realising how poor in spirit he is, how utterly devoid
of anything like righteousness, goodness, or
any quality which would commend him to God, his
pride within utterly blasted and dead, falls down
with humiliation and despair before God, while he
utters a sharp cry for mercy for his sins and his
guilt. A sense of sin and a realisation of utter unworthiness
has fixed the roots of humility deep
down in his soul, and has oppressed self and eye
and heart, downward to the dust. This is the
picture of humility against pride in praying. Here
we see by sharp contrast the utter worthlessness of
self-righteousness, self-exaltation, and self-praise in
praying, and the great value, the beauty and the
Divine commendation which comes to humility
of heart, self-depreciation, and self-condemnation
when a soul comes before God in prayer.</p>

<p>Happy are they who have no righteousness of
their own to plead and no goodness of their own of
which to boast. Humility flourishes in the soil of
a true and deep sense of our sinfulness and our
nothingness. Nowhere does humility grow so
rankly and so rapidly and shine so brilliantly, as
when it feels all guilty, confesses all sin, and trusts
all grace. “I the chief of sinners am, but Jesus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
died for me.” That is praying ground, the ground
of humility, low down, far away seemingly, but in
reality brought nigh by the blood of the Lord Jesus
Christ. God dwells in the lowly places. He makes
such lowly places really the high places to the
praying soul.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“Let the world their virtue boast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Their works of righteousness;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I, a wretch undone and lost,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Am freely saved by grace;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Other title I disclaim,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">I the chief of sinners am,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But Jesus died for me.”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Humility is an indispensable requisite of true
prayer. It must be an attribute, a characteristic of
prayer. Humility must be in the praying character
as light is in the sun. Prayer has no beginning, no
ending, no being, without humility. As a ship is
made for the sea, so prayer is made for humility,
and so humility is made for prayer.</p>

<p>Humility is not abstraction from self, nor does
it ignore thought about self. It is a many-phased
principle. Humility is born by looking at God, and
His holiness, and then looking at self and man’s
unholiness. Humility loves obscurity and silence,
dreads applause, esteems the virtues of others, excuses
their faults with mildness, easily pardons injuries,
fears contempt less and less, and sees
baseness and falsehood in pride. A true nobleness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
and greatness are in humility. It knows and reveres
the inestimable riches of the Cross, and the
humiliations of Jesus Christ. It fears the lustre of
those virtues admired by men, and loves those
that are more secret and which are prized by God.
It draws comfort even from its own defects,
through the abasement which they occasion. It
prefers any degree of compunction before all light
in the world.</p>

<p>Somewhat after this order of description is that
definable grace of humility, so perfectly drawn in
the publican’s prayer, and so entirely absent from
the prayer of the Pharisee. It takes many sittings
to make a good picture of it.</p>

<p>Humility holds in its keeping the very life of
prayer. Neither pride nor vanity can pray. Humility,
though, is much more than the absence of
vanity and pride. It is a positive quality, a substantial
force, which energises prayer. There is no
power in prayer to ascend without it. Humility
springs from a lowly estimate of ourselves and of
our deservings. The Pharisee prayed not, though
well schooled and habituated to pray, because there
was no humility in his praying. The publican
prayed, though banned by the public and receiving
no encouragement from Church sentiment, because
he prayed in humility. To be clothed with humility
is to be clothed with a praying garment. Humility
is just feeling little because we <em>are</em> little. Humility
is realising our unworthiness because we <em>are</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
unworthy, the feeling and declaring ourselves sinners
because we <em>are</em> sinners. Kneeling well becomes
us as the attitude of prayer, because it betokens
humility.</p>

<p>The Pharisee’s proud estimate of himself and his
supreme contempt for his neighbour closed the gates
of prayer to him, while humility opened wide those
gates to the defamed and reviled publican.</p>

<p>That fearful saying of our Lord about the works
of big, religious workers in the latter part of the
Sermon on the Mount, is called out by proud estimates
of work and wrong estimates of prayer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Many shall say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord,
have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name
cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful
works? And then will I profess unto them, I
never knew you: depart from me, ye that work
iniquity.”</p>
</div>

<p>Humility is the first and last attribute of Christly
religion, and the first and last attribute of Christly
praying. There is no Christ without humility.
There is no praying without humility. If thou
wouldst learn well the art of praying, then learn
well the lesson of humility.</p>

<p>How graceful and imperative does the attitude
of humility become to us! Humility is one of the
unchanging and exacting attitudes of prayer.
Dust, ashes, earth upon the head, sackcloth for the
body, and fasting for the appetites, were the symbols<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
of humility for the Old Testament saints.
Sackcloth, fasting and ashes brought Daniel a lowliness
before God, and brought Gabriel to him.
The angels are fond of the sackcloth-and-ashes men.</p>

<p>How lowly the attitude of Abraham, the friend
of God, when pleading for God to stay His wrath
against Sodom! “Which am but sackcloth and
ashes.” With what humility does Solomon appear
before God! His grandeur is abased, and his glory
and majesty are retired as he assumes the rightful
attitude before God: “I am but a little child, and
know not how to go out or to come in.”</p>

<p>The pride of doing sends its poison all through
our praying. The same pride of being infects all
our prayers, no matter how well-worded they may
be. It was this lack of humility, this self-applauding,
this self-exaltation, which kept the most religious
man of Christ’s day from being accepted of
God. And the same thing will keep us in this day
from being accepted of Him.</p>

<h4>PRAYER AND DEVOTION
</h4>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Once as I rode out into the woods for my health, in 1737,
having alighted from my horse in a retired place, as my manner
commonly had been to walk for divine contemplation and
prayer, I had a view that for me was extraordinary, of the
glory of the Son of God. As near as I can judge, this continued
about an hour; and kept me the greater part of the
time in a flood of tears and weeping aloud. I felt an ardency
of soul to be what I know not otherwise how to express,
emptied and annihilated; to love Him with a holy and pure
love; to serve and follow Him; to be perfectly sanctified and
made pure with a divine and heavenly purity.”—<span class="smcap">Jonathan
Edwards.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="p2 drop-cap">D<span class="smcap">evotion</span> has a religious signification.
The root of devotion is to devote to a
sacred use. So that devotion in its true
sense has to do with religious worship. It stands
intimately connected with true prayer. Devotion is
the particular frame of mind found in one entirely
devoted to God. It is the spirit of reverence, of
awe, of godly fear. It is a state of heart which
appears before God in prayer and worship. It is
foreign to everything like lightness of spirit, and is
opposed to levity and noise and bluster. Devotion
dwells in the realm of quietness and is still before
God. It is serious, thoughtful, meditative.</p>

<p>Devotion belongs to the inner life and lives in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
the closet, but also appears in the public services of
the sanctuary. It is a part of the very spirit of true
worship, and is of the nature of the spirit of prayer.</p>

<p>Devotion belongs to the devout man, whose
thoughts and feelings are devoted to God. Such a
man has a mind given up wholly to religion, and
possesses a strong affection for God and an ardent
love for His house. Cornelius was “a devout man,
one that feared God with all his house, which gave
much alms to the people, and prayed always.”
“Devout men carried Stephen to his burial.”
“One Ananias, a devout man, according to the
law,” was sent unto Saul when he was blind, to tell
him what the Lord would have him do. God can
wonderfully use such men, for devout men are His
chosen agents in carrying forward His plans.</p>

<p>Prayer promotes the spirit of devotion, while
devotion is favourable to the best praying. Devotion
furthers prayer and helps to drive prayer home
to the object which it seeks. Prayer thrives in the
atmosphere of true devotion. It is easy to pray when
in the spirit of devotion. The attitude of mind and
the state of heart implied in devotion make prayer
effectual in reaching the throne of grace. God
dwells where the spirit of devotion resides. All the
graces of the Spirit are nourished and grow well in
the environment created by devotion. Indeed, these
graces grow nowhere else but here. The absence of
a devotional spirit means death to the graces born
in a renewed heart. True worship finds congeniality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
in the atmosphere made by a spirit of devotion.
While prayer is helpful to devotion, at the same
time devotion reacts on prayer, and helps us to pray.</p>

<p>Devotion engages the heart in prayer. It is not
an easy task for the lips to try to pray while the
heart is absent from it. The charge which God at
one time made against His ancient Israel was, that
they honoured Him with their lips while their hearts
were far from Him.</p>

<p>The very essence of prayer is the spirit of devotion.
Without devotion prayer is an empty form,
a vain round of words. Sad to say, much of this
kind of prayer prevails, today, in the Church. This
is a busy age, bustling and active, and this bustling
spirit has invaded the Church of God. Its religious
performances are many. The Church works
at religion with the order, precision and force of
real machinery. But too often it works with the
heartlessness of the machine. There is much of the
treadmill movement in our ceaseless round and
routine of religious doings. We pray without
praying. We sing without singing with the Spirit
and the understanding. We have music without
the praise of God being in it, or near it. We go to
Church by habit, and come home all too gladly
when the benediction is pronounced. We read our
accustomed chapter in the Bible, and feel quite relieved
when the task is done. We say our prayers
by rote, as a schoolboy recites his lesson, and are
not sorry when the Amen is uttered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
Religion has to do with everything but our
hearts. It engages our hands and feet, it takes
hold of our voices, it lays its hands on our money,
it affects even the postures of our bodies, but it
does not take hold of our affections, our desires,
our zeal, and make us serious, desperately in
earnest, and cause us to be quiet and worshipful in
the presence of God. Social affinities attract us to
the house of God, not the spirit of the occasion.
Church membership keeps us after a fashion decent
in outward conduct and with some shadow of
loyalty to our baptismal vows, but the heart is not
in the thing. It remains cold, formal, and unimpressed
amid all this outward performance, while
we give ourselves over to self-congratulation that
we are doing wonderfully well religiously.</p>

<p>Why all these sad defects in our piety? Why
this modern perversion of the true nature of the
religion of Jesus Christ? Why is the modern type
of religion so much like a jewel-case, with the
precious jewels gone? Why so much of this
handling religion with the hands, often not too
clean or unsoiled, and so little of it felt in the
heart and witnessed in the life?</p>

<p>The great lack of modern religion is the spirit
of devotion. We hear sermons in the same spirit
with which we listen to a lecture or hear a speech.
We visit the house of God just as if it were a
common place, on a level with the theatre, the
lecture-room or the forum. We look upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
minister of God not as the divinely-called man of
God, but merely as a sort of public speaker, on a
plane with the politician, the lawyer, or the average
speech maker, or the lecturer. Oh, how the spirit
of true and genuine devotion would radically change
all this for the better! We handle sacred things
just as if they were the things of the world. Even
the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper becomes a mere
religious performance, no preparation for it beforehand,
and no meditation and prayer afterward.
Even the sacrament of Baptism has lost much of
its solemnity, and degenerated into a mere form,
with nothing specially in it.</p>

<p>We need the spirit of devotion, not only to
salt our secularities, but to make praying real prayers.
We need to put the spirit of devotion into
Monday’s business as well as in Sunday’s worship.
We need the spirit of devotion, to recollect always
the presence of God, to be always doing the will of
God, to direct all things always to the glory of God.</p>

<p>The spirit of devotion puts God in all things. It
puts God not merely in our praying and Church
going, but in all the concerns of life. “Whether,
therefore, ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do
all to the glory of God.” The spirit of devotion
makes the common things of earth sacred, and the
little things great. With this spirit of devotion, we
go to business on Monday directed by the very same
influence, and inspired by the same influences by
which we went to Church on Sunday. The spirit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
of devotion makes a Sabbath out of Saturday, and
transforms the shop and the office into a temple
of God.</p>

<p>The spirit of devotion removes religion from being
a thin veneer, and puts it into the very life and
being of our souls. With it religion ceases to be doing
a mere work, and becomes a heart, sending its
rich blood through every artery and beating with
the pulsations of vigourous and radiant life.</p>

<p>The spirit of devotion is not merely the aroma
of religion, but the stalk and stem on which religion
grows. It is the salt which penetrates and
makes savoury all religious acts. It is the sugar
which sweetens duty, self-denial and sacrifice. It
is the bright colouring which relieves the dullness
of religious performances. It dispels frivolity
and drives away all skin-deep forms of
worship, and makes worship a serious and deep-seated
service, impregnating body, soul and spirit
with its heavenly infusion. Let us ask in all
seriousness, has this highest angel of heaven, this
heavenly spirit of devotion, this brightest and
best angel of earth, left us? When the angel
of devotion has gone, the angel of prayer has
lost its wings, and it becomes a deformed and
loveless thing.</p>

<p>The ardour of devotion is in prayer. In the
fourth chapter of Revelation, verse eight, we read:
“And they rest not day nor night, saying, Holy,
Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
is, and is to come.” The inspiration and centre of
their rapturous devotion is the holiness of God.
That holiness of God claims their attention, inflames
their devotion. There is nothing cold,
nothing dull, nothing wearisome about them or
their heavenly worship. “They rest not day nor
night.” What zeal! What unfainting ardour and
ceaseless rapture! The ministry of prayer, if it be
anything worthy of the name, is a ministry of
ardour, a ministry of unwearied and intense longing
after God and after His holiness.</p>

<p>The spirit of devotion pervades the saints in
heaven and characterizes the worship of heaven’s
angelic intelligences. No devotionless creatures are
in that heavenly world. God is there, and His very
presence begets the spirit of reverence, of awe, and
of filial fear. If we would be partakers with them
after death, we must first learn the spirit of devotion
on earth before we get there.</p>

<p>These living creatures in their restless, tireless,
attitude after God, and their rapt devotion to His
holiness, are the perfect symbols and illustrations
of true prayer and its ardour. Prayer must be
aflame. Its ardour must consume. Prayer without
fervour is as a sun without light or heat, or as a
flower without beauty or fragrance. A soul devoted
to God is a fervent soul, and prayer is the creature
of that flame. He only can truly pray who is all
aglow for holiness, for God, and for heaven.</p>

<p>Activity is not strength. Work is not zeal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
Moving about is not devotion. Activity often is
the unrecognised symptom of spiritual weakness.
It may be hurtful to piety when made the substitute
for real devotion in worship. The colt is much
more active than its mother, but she is the wheelhorse
of the team, pulling the load without noise or
bluster or show. The child is more active than the
father, who may be bearing the rule and burdens of
an empire on his heart and shoulders. Enthusiasm
is more active than faith, though it cannot remove
mountains nor call into action any of the omnipotent
forces which faith can command.</p>

<p>A feeble, lively, showy religious activity may
spring from many causes. There is much running
around, much stirring about, much going here and
there, in present-day Church life, but sad to say,
the spirit of genuine, heartfelt devotion is strangely
lacking. If there be real spiritual life, a deep-toned
activity will spring from it. But it is an activity
springing from strength and not from weakness.
It is an activity which has deep roots, many and
strong.</p>

<p>In the nature of things, religion must show much
of its growth above ground. Much will be seen and
be evident to the eye. The flower and fruit of a
holy life, abounding in good works, must be seen.
It cannot be otherwise. But the surface growth
must be based on a vigourous growth of unseen life
and hidden roots. Deep down in the renewed nature
must the roots of religion go which is seen on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
the outside. The external must have a deep internal
groundwork. There must be much of the
invisible and the underground growth, or else the
life will be feeble and short-lived, and the external
growth sickly and fruitless.</p>

<p>In the Book of the prophet Isaiah these words
are written:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“They that wait on the Lord shall renew their
strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles;
they shall run and not be weary; and they shall walk
and not faint.” 40:31.</p>
</div>

<p>This is the genesis of the whole matter of activity
and strength of the most energetic, exhaustless
and untiring nature. All this is the result of
waiting on God.</p>

<p>There may be much of activity induced by drill,
created by enthusiasm, the product of the weakness
of the flesh, the inspiration of volatile, short-lived
forces. Activity is often at the expense of more solid,
useful elements, and generally to the total neglect of
prayer. To be too busy with God’s work to commune
with God, to be busy with doing Church work
without taking time to talk to God about His work,
is the highway to backsliding, and many people have
walked therein to the hurt of their immortal souls.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding great activity, great enthusiasm,
and much hurrah for the work, the work and
the activity will be but blindness without the cultivation
and the maturity of the graces of prayer.</p>

<h4>PRAYER, PRAISE AND THANKSGIVING
</h4>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Dr. A. J. Gordon describes the impression made upon his
mind by intercourse with Joseph Rabinowitz, whom Dr.
Delitzsch considered the most remarkable Jewish convert
since Saul of Tarsus: ‘We shall not soon forget the radiance
that would come into his face as he expounded the Messianic
psalms at our morning or evening worship, and how, as here
and there he caught a glimpse of the suffering or glorified
Christ, he would suddenly lift his hands and his eyes to
heaven in a burst of adoration, exclaiming with Thomas after
he had seen the nail-prints, “My Lord, and my God.”’”</p>

<p class="right">
—<span class="smcap">D. M. McIntyre.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p class="p2 drop-cap">P<span class="smcap">rayer</span>, praise and thanksgiving all go in
company. A close relationship exists between
them. Praise and thanksgiving are
so near alike that it is not easy to distinguish between
them or define them separately. The Scriptures
join these three things together. Many are
the causes for thanksgiving and praise. The
Psalms are filled with many songs of praise and
hymns of thanksgiving, all pointing back to the
results of prayer. Thanksgiving includes gratitude.
In fact thanksgiving is but the expression of an
inward conscious gratitude to God for mercies received.
Gratitude is an inward emotion of the soul,
involuntarily arising therein, while thanksgiving is
the voluntary expression of gratitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
Thanksgiving is oral, positive, active. It is the
giving out of something to God. Thanksgiving
comes out into the open. Gratitude is secret, silent,
negative, passive, not showing its being till expressed
in praise and thanksgiving. Gratitude is
felt in the heart. Thanksgiving is the expression of
that inward feeling.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving is just what the word itself signifies—the
giving of thanks to God. It is giving
something to God in words which we feel at heart
for blessings received. Gratitude arises from a
contemplation of the goodness of God. It is bred
by serious meditation on what God has done for
us. Both gratitude and thanksgiving point to,
and have to do with God and His mercies. The
heart is consciously grateful to God. The soul
gives expression to that heartfelt gratitude to God
in words or acts.</p>

<p>Gratitude is born of meditation on God’s grace
and mercy. “The Lord hath done great things for
us, whereof we are glad.” Herein we see the value
of serious meditation. “My meditation of him
shall be sweet.” Praise is begotten by gratitude and
a conscious obligation to God for mercies given.
As we think of mercies past, the heart is inwardly
moved to gratitude.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“I love to think on mercies past,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And future good implore;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all my cares and sorrows cast</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">On Him whom I adore.”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
Love is the child of gratitude. Love grows as
gratitude is felt, and then breaks out into praise and
thanksgiving to God: “I love the Lord because he
hath heard my voice and my supplication.” Answered
prayers cause gratitude, and gratitude
brings forth a love that declares it will not cease
praying: “Because he hath inclined his ear unto
me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.”
Gratitude and love move to larger and increased
praying.</p>

<p>Paul appeals to the Romans to dedicate themselves
wholly to God, a living sacrifice, and the
constraining motive is the mercies of God:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies
of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice,
holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable
service.”</p>
</div>

<p>Consideration of God’s mercies not only begets
gratitude, but induces a large consecration to God
of all we have and are. So that prayer, thanksgiving
and consecration are all linked together
inseparably.</p>

<p>Gratitude and thanksgiving always looks back at
the past though it may also take in the present. But
prayer always looks to the future. Thanksgiving
deals with things already received. Prayer deals
with things desired, asked for and expected. Prayer
turns to gratitude and praise when the things asked
for have been granted by God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
As prayer brings things to us which beget gratitude
and thanksgiving, so praise and gratitude promote
prayer, and induce more praying and better
praying.</p>

<p>Gratitude and thanksgiving forever stand opposed
to all murmurings at God’s dealings with us,
and all complainings at our lot. Gratitude and
murmuring never abide in the same heart at the
same time. An unappreciative spirit has no standing
beside gratitude and praise. And true prayer
corrects complaining and promotes gratitude and
thanksgiving. Dissatisfaction at one’s lot, and a
disposition to be discontented with things which
come to us in the providence of God, are foes to
gratitude and enemies to thanksgiving.</p>

<p>The murmurers are ungrateful people. Appreciative
men and women have neither the time nor
disposition to stop and complain. The bane of the
wilderness-journey of the Israelites on their way to
Canaan was their proneness to murmur and complain
against God and Moses. For this, God was
several times greatly grieved, and it took the strong
praying of Moses to avert God’s wrath because of
these murmurings. The absence of gratitude left
no room nor disposition for praise and thanksgiving,
just as it is so always. But when these same
Israelites were brought through the Red Sea dry
shod, while their enemies were destroyed, there was
a song of praise led by Miriam, the sister of Moses.
One of the leading sins of these Israelites was forgetfulness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
of God and His mercies, and ingratitude
of soul. This brought forth murmurings and lack
of praise, as it always does.</p>

<p>When Paul wrote to the Colossians to let the
word of Christ dwell in their hearts richly and to
let the peace of God rule therein, he said to them,
“and be ye thankful,” and adds, “admonishing
yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual
songs, singing with grace in your hearts unto
the Lord.”</p>

<p>Further on, in writing to these same Christians,
he joins prayer and thanksgiving together: “Continue
in prayer, and watch in the same with
thanksgiving.”</p>

<p>And writing to the Thessalonians, he again joins
them in union: “Rejoice evermore. Pray without
ceasing. In everything give thanks, for this is the
will of God concerning you.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“We thank Thee, Lord of heaven and earth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who hast preserved us from our birth;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Redeemed us oft from death and dread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with Thy gifts our table spread.”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Wherever there is true prayer, there thanksgiving
and gratitude stand hard by, ready to respond
to the answer when it comes. For as prayer brings
the answer, so the answer brings forth gratitude and
praise. As prayer sets God to work, so answered
prayer sets thanksgiving to work. Thanksgiving
follows answered prayer just as day succeeds night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
True prayer and gratitude lead to full consecration,
and consecration leads to more praying and
better praying. A consecrated life is both a prayer-life
and a thanksgiving life.</p>

<p>The spirit of praise was once the boast of the
primitive Church. This spirit abode on the tabernacles
of these early Christians, as a cloud of glory
out of which God shined and spoke. It filled their
temples with the perfume of costly, flaming incense.
That this spirit of praise is sadly deficient in our
present-day congregations must be evident to every
careful observer. That it is a mighty force in projecting
the Gospel, and its body of vital forces,
must be equally evident. To restore the spirit of
praise to our congregations should be one of the
main points with every true pastor. The normal
state of the Church is set forth in the declaration
made to God in Psalm 65: “Praise waiteth for
thee, O Lord, and unto thee shall the vow be
performed.”</p>

<p>Praise is so distinctly and definitely wedded to
prayer, so inseparably joined, that they cannot be
divorced. Praise is dependent on prayer for its full
volume and its sweetest melody.</p>

<p>Singing is one method of praise, not the highest
it is true, but it is the ordinary and usual form.
The singing service in our churches has much to
do with praise, for according to the character of the
singing will be the genuineness or the measure of
praise. The singing may be so directed as to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
in it elements which deprave and debauch prayer.
It may be so directed as to drive away everything
like thanksgiving and praise. Much of modern
singing in our churches is entirely foreign to anything
like hearty, sincere praise to God.</p>

<p>The spirit of prayer and of true praise go hand
in hand. Both are often entirely dissipated by the
flippant, thoughtless, light singing in our congregations.
Much of the singing lacks serious thought
and is devoid of everything like a devotional spirit.
Its lustiness and sparkle may not only dissipate all
the essential features of worship, but may substitute
the flesh for the spirit.</p>

<p>Giving thanks is the very life of prayer. It is its
fragrance and music, its poetry and its crown.
Prayer bringing the desired answer breaks out into
praise and thanksgiving. So that whatever interferes
with and injures the spirit of prayer necessarily
hurts and dissipates the spirit of praise.</p>

<p>The heart must have in it the grace of prayer to
sing the praise of God. Spiritual singing is not to
be done by musical taste or talent, but by the grace
of God in the heart. Nothing helps praise so
mightily as a gracious revival of true religion in the
Church. The conscious presence of God inspires
song. The angels and the glorified ones in heaven
do not need artistic precentors to lead them, nor do
they care for paid choirs to chime in with their
heavenly doxologies of praise and worship. They
are not dependent on singing schools to teach them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
the notes and scale of singing. Their singing involuntarily
breaks forth from the heart.</p>

<p>God is immediately present in the heavenly assemblies
of the angels and the spirits of just men
made perfect. His glorious presence creates the
song, teaches the singing, and impregnates their
notes of praise. It is so on earth. God’s presence
begets singing and thanksgiving, while the absence
of God from our congregations is the death of song,
or, which amounts to the same, makes the singing
lifeless, cold and formal. His conscious presence
in our churches would bring back the days of praise
and would restore the full chorus of song.</p>

<p>Where grace abounds, song abounds. When
God is in the heart, heaven is present and melody is
there, and the lips overflow out of the abundance of
the heart. This is as true in the private life of the
believer as it is so in the congregations of the saints.
The decay of singing, the dying down and out of
the spirit of praise in song, means the decline of
grace in the heart and the absence of God’s presence
from the people.</p>

<p>The main design of all singing is for God’s ear
and to attract His attention and to please Him. It
is “to the Lord,” for His glory, and to His honour.
Certainly it is not for the glorification of the paid
choir, to exalt the wonderful musical powers of the
singers, nor is it to draw the people to the church,
but it is for the glory of God and the good of the
souls of the congregation. Alas! How far has the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
singing of choirs of churches of modern times departed
from this idea! It is no surprise that there
is no life, no power, no unction, no spirit, in much
of the Church singing heard in this day. It is
sacrilege for any but sanctified hearts and holy lips
to direct the singing part of the service of God’s
house of prayer. Much of the singing in churches
would do credit to the opera house, and might satisfy
as mere entertainments, pleasing the ear, but
as a part of real worship, having in it the spirit of
praise and prayer, it is a fraud, an imposition on
spiritually minded people, and entirely unacceptable
to God. The cry should go out afresh, “Let all the
people praise the Lord,” for “it is good to sing
praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise
is comely.”</p>

<p>The music of praise, for there is real music of
soul in praise, is too hopeful and happy to be denied.
All these are in the “giving of thanks.” In
Philippians, prayer is called “requests.” “Let
your requests be made known unto God,” which
describes prayer as an asking for a gift, giving
prominence to the thing asked for, making it emphatic,
something to be given by God and received
by us, and not something to be done by us. And
all this is closely connected with gratitude to God,
“with thanksgiving, let your requests be made
known unto God.”</p>

<p>God does much for us in answer to prayer, but
we need from Him many gifts, and for them we are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
to make special prayer. According to our special
needs, so must our praying be. We are to be special
and particular and bring to the knowledge of God
by prayer, supplication and thanksgiving, our particular
requests, the things we need, the things we
greatly desire. And with it all, accompanying all
these requests, there must be thanksgiving.</p>

<p>It is indeed a pleasing thought that what we are
called upon to do on earth, to praise and give
thanks, the angels in heaven and the redeemed disembodied
spirits of the saints are doing also. It is
still further pleasing to contemplate the glorious
hope that what God wants us to do on earth, we will
be engaged in doing throughout an unending eternity.
Praise and thanksgiving will be our blessed
employment while we remain in heaven. Nor will
we ever grow weary of this pleasing task.</p>

<p>Joseph Addison sets before us, in verse, this
pleasing prospect:</p>

<p class="p2 drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">rouble</span> and prayer are closely related to
each other. Prayer is of great value to
trouble. Trouble often drives men to God
in prayer, while prayer is but the voice of men in
trouble. There is great value in prayer in the time
of trouble. Prayer often delivers out of trouble,
and still oftener gives strength to bear trouble,
ministers comfort in trouble, and begets patience in
the midst of trouble. Wise is he in the day of
trouble who knows his true source of strength and
who fails not to pray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
Trouble belongs to the present state of man on
earth. “Man that is born of a woman is of few
days and full of trouble.” Trouble is common to
man. There is no exception in any age or clime or
station. Rich and poor alike, the learned and the
ignorant, one and all are partakers of this sad and
painful inheritance of the fall of man. “There
hath no temptation taken you but such as is common
to man.” The “day of trouble” dawns on
every one at some time in his life. “The evil days
come and the years draw nigh” when the heart
feels its heavy pressure.</p>

<p>That is an entirely false view of life and shows
supreme ignorance that expects nothing but sunshine
and looks only for ease, pleasure and flowers.
It is this class who are so sadly disappointed and
surprised when trouble breaks into their lives.
These are the ones who know not God, who know
nothing of His disciplinary dealings with His
people and who are prayerless.</p>

<p>What an infinite variety there is in the troubles
of life! How diversified the experiences of men in
the school of trouble! No two people have the same
troubles under like environments. God deals with no
two of His children in the same way. And as God
varies His treatment of His children, so trouble is
varied. God does not repeat Himself. He does not
run in a rut. He has not one pattern for every child.
Each trouble is proportioned to each child. Each
one is dealt with according to his own peculiar case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
Trouble is God’s servant, doing His will unless
He is defeated in the execution of that will. Trouble
is under the control of Almighty God, and is one
of His most efficient agents in fulfilling His purposes
and in perfecting His saints. God’s hand is
in every trouble which breaks into the lives of men.
Not that He directly and arbitrarily orders every
unpleasant experience of life. Not that He is personally
responsible for every painful and afflicting
thing which comes into the lives of His people.
But no trouble is ever turned loose in this world
and comes into the life of saint or sinner, but comes
with Divine permission, and is allowed to exist and
do its painful work with God’s hand in it or on it,
carrying out His gracious designs of redemption.</p>

<p>All things are under Divine control. Trouble is
neither above God nor beyond His control. It is
not something in life independent of God. No
matter from what source it springs nor whence it
arises, God is sufficiently wise and able to lay His
hand upon it without assuming responsibility for
its origin, and work it into His plans and purposes
concerning the highest welfare of His saints. This
is the explanation of that gracious statement in
Romans, so often quoted, but the depth of whose
meaning has rarely been sounded, “And we know
that all things work together for good to them that
love God.”</p>

<p>Even the evils brought about by the forces of
nature are His servants, carrying out His will and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
fulfilling His designs. God even claims the locusts,
the cankerworm, the caterpillar are His servants,
“My great army,” used by Him to correct His
people and discipline them.</p>

<p>Trouble belongs to the disciplinary part of the
moral government of God. This is a life of probation,
where the human race is on probation. It
is a season of trial. Trouble is not penal in its
nature. It belongs to what the Scriptures call
“chastening.” “Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth,
and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.”
Speaking accurately, punishment does not belong to
this life. Punishment for sin will take place in the
next world. God’s dealings with people in this
world are of the nature of discipline. They are corrective
processes in His plans concerning man. It
is because of this that prayer comes in when trouble
arises. Prayer belongs to the discipline of life.</p>

<p>As trouble is not sinful in itself, neither is it the
evidence of sin. Good and bad alike experience
trouble. As the rain falls alike on the just and unjust,
so drouth likewise comes to the righteous and
the wicked. Trouble is no evidence whatever of the
Divine displeasure. Scripture instances without
number disprove any such idea. Job is a case in
point, where God bore explicit testimony to his deep
piety, and yet God permitted Satan to afflict him
beyond any other man for wise and beneficent purposes.
Trouble has no power in itself to interfere
with the relations of a saint to God. “Who shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation,
or distress, or persecution, or famine, or
nakedness, or peril, or sword?”</p>

<p>Three words practically the same in the processes
of Divine discipline are found, temptation, trial and
trouble, and yet there is a difference between them.
Temptation is really a solicitation to evil arising
from the devil or born in the carnal nature of man.
Trial is testing. It is that which proves us, tests
us, and makes us stronger and better when we submit
to the trial and work together with God in it.
“My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into
divers temptations; knowing this, that the trying of
your faith worketh patience.”</p>

<p>Peter speaks along the same line:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Wherein ye greatly rejoice, now for a season, if
need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations;
that the trial of your faith being much more
precious than that of gold that perisheth, though it be
tried with fire, might be found unto praise, and honor
and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.”</p>
</div>

<p>The third word is trouble itself, which covers all
the painful, sorrowing, and grievous events of life.
And yet temptations and trials might really become
troubles. So that all evil days in life might well be
classed under the head of the “time of trouble.”
And such days of trouble are the lot of all men.
Enough to know that trouble, no matter from what
source it comes, becomes in God’s hand His own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
agent to accomplish His gracious work concerning
those who submit patiently to Him, who recognise
Him in prayer, and who work together with God.</p>

<p>Let us settle down at once to the idea that trouble
arises not by chance, and neither occurs by what
men call accident. “Although affliction cometh not
forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of
the ground, yet man is born unto trouble as the
sparks fly upward.” Trouble naturally belongs to
God’s moral government, and is one of His invaluable
agents in governing the world.</p>

<p>When we realise this, we can the better understand
much that is recorded in the Scriptures, and
can have a clearer conception of God’s dealings with
His ancient Israel. In God’s dealings with them,
we find what is called a history of Divine Providence,
and providence always embraces trouble.
No one can understand the story of Joseph and his
old father Jacob unless he takes into the account
trouble and its varied offices. God takes account of
trouble when He urges His prophet Isaiah on
this wise:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your
God. Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry
unto her that her warfare is accomplished, that her
iniquity is pardoned.”</p>
</div>

<p>There is a distinct note of comfort in the Gospel
for the praying saints of the Lord, and He is a wise
scribe in Divine things who knows how to minister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
this comfort to the broken-hearted and sad ones of
earth. Jesus Himself said to His sad disciples, “I
will not leave you comfortless.”</p>

<p>All the foregoing has been said that we may
rightly appreciate the relationship of prayer to
trouble. In the time of trouble, where does prayer
come in? The Psalmist tells us: “Call upon me in
the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt
glorify me.” Prayer is the most appropriate thing
for a soul to do in the “time of trouble.” Prayer
recognises God in the day of trouble. “It is the
Lord; let him do what seemeth him good.” Prayer
sees God’s hand in trouble, and prays about it.
Nothing more truly shows us our helplessness than
when trouble comes. It brings the strong man low,
it discloses our weakness, it brings a sense of helplessness.
Blessed is he who knows how to turn to
God in “the time of trouble.” If trouble is of the
Lord, then the most natural thing to do is to carry
the trouble to the Lord, and seek grace and patience
and submission. It is the time to inquire in the
trouble, “Lord, what, wilt thou have me to do?”
How natural and reasonable for the soul, oppressed,
broken, and bruised, to bow low at the
footstool of mercy and seek the face of God?
Where could a soul in trouble more likely find solace
than in the closet?</p>

<p>Alas! trouble does not always drive men to God
in prayer. Sad is the case of him who, when trouble
bends his spirit down and grieves his heart, yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
knows not whence the trouble comes nor knows
how to pray about it. Blessed is the man who is
driven by trouble to his knees in prayer!</p>

<p>Prayer in the time of trouble brings comfort,
help, hope, and blessings, which, while not removing
the trouble, enable the saint the better to bear
it and to submit to the will of God. Prayer opens
the eyes to see God’s hand in trouble. Prayer does
not interpret God’s providences, but it does justify
them and recognise God in them. Prayer enables
us to see wise ends in trouble. Prayer in trouble
drives us away from unbelief, saves us from doubt,
and delivers from all vain and foolish questionings
because of our painful experiences. Let us not lose
sight of the tribute paid to Job when all his troubles
came to the culminating point: “In all this Job
sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.”</p>

<p>Alas! for vain, ignorant men, without faith in
God and knowing nothing of God’s disciplinary
processes in dealing with men, who charge God
foolishly when troubles come, and who are tempted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
to “curse God.” How silly and vain are the complainings,
the murmurings and the rebellion of men
in the time of trouble! What need to read again the
story of the Children of Israel in the wilderness!
And how useless is all our fretting, our worrying
over trouble, as if such unhappy doings on our part
could change things! “And which of you with
taking thought, can add to his stature one cubit?”
How much wiser, how much better, how much
easier to bear life’s troubles when we take everything
to God in prayer?</p>

<p>Trouble has wise ends for the praying ones, and
these find it so. Happy is he who, like the Psalmist,
finds that his troubles have been blessings in disguise.
“It is good for me that I have been afflicted,
that I might learn thy statutes. I know, O
Lord, that thy judgments are right, and that thou
in faithfulness hast afflicted me.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Of course it may be conceded that some troubles
are really imaginary. They have no existence other
than in the mind. Some are anticipated troubles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
which never arrive at our door. Others are past
troubles, and there is much folly in worrying
over them. Present troubles are the ones requiring
attention and demanding prayer. “Sufficient
unto the day is the evil thereof.” Some
troubles are self-originated. We are their authors.
Some of these originate involuntarily with us, some
arise from our ignorance, some come from our
carelessness. All this can be readily admitted without
breaking the force of the statement that they are
the subjects of prayer, and should drive us to
prayer. What father casts off his child who cries
to him when the little one from its own carelessness
has stumbled and fallen and hurt itself? Does not
the cry of the child attract the ears of the father
even though the child be to blame for the accident?
“Whatever things ye desire” takes in every
event of life, even though some events we are responsible
for.</p>

<p>Some troubles are human in their origin. They
arise from second causes. They originate with
others and we are the sufferers. This is a world
where often the innocent suffer the consequences of
the acts of others. This is a part of life’s incidents.
Who has not at some time suffered at the hands of
others? But even these are allowed to come in the
order of God’s providence, are permitted to break
into our lives for beneficent ends, and may be
prayed over. Why should we not carry our hurts,
our wrongs and our privations, caused by the acts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
of others, to God in prayer? Are such things outside
of the realm of prayer? Are they exceptions
to the rule of prayer? Not at all. And God can
and will lay His hand upon all such events in answer
to prayer, and cause them to work for us “a far
more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.”</p>

<p>Nearly all of Paul’s troubles arose from wicked
and unreasonable men. Read the story as he gives
it in II Corinthians 11:23-33.</p>

<p>So also some troubles are directly of Satanic
origin. Quite all of Job’s troubles were the offspring
of the devil’s scheme to break down Job’s
integrity, to make him charge God foolishly and to
curse God. But are these not to be recognised in
prayer? Are they to be excluded from God’s disciplinary
processes? Job did not do so. Hear him
in those familiar words. “The Lord gave, and the
Lord hath taken away. Blessed be the name of
the Lord.”</p>

<p>O what a comfort to see God in all of life’s
events! What a relief to a broken, sorrowing heart
to see God’s hand in sorrow! What a source of
relief is prayer in unburdening the heart in grief!</p>

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But when we survey all the sources from which
trouble comes, it all resolves itself into two invaluable
truths: First, that our troubles at last are of
the Lord. They come with His consent. He is in
all of them, and is interested in us when they press
and bruise us. And secondly, that our troubles, no
matter what the cause, whether of ourselves, or men
or devils, or even God Himself, we are warranted in
taking them to God in prayer, in praying over them,
and in seeking to get the greatest spiritual benefits
out of them.</p>

<p>Prayer in the time of trouble tends to bring the
spirit into perfect subjection to the will of God, to
cause the will to be conformed to God’s will, and
saves from all murmurings over our lot, and delivers
from everything like a rebellious heart or a
spirit critical of the Lord. Prayer sanctifies trouble
to our highest good. Prayer so prepares the
heart that it softens under the disciplining hand of
God. Prayer places us where God can bring to us
the greatest good, spiritual and eternal. Prayer
allows God to freely work with us and in us in the
day of trouble. Prayer removes everything in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
way of trouble, bringing to us the sweetest, the
highest and greatest good. Prayer permits God’s
servant, trouble, to accomplish its mission in us,
with us and for us.</p>

<p>The end of trouble is always good in the mind of
God. If trouble fails in its mission, it is either
because of prayerlessness or unbelief, or both. Being
in harmony with God in the dispensations of
His providence, always makes trouble a blessing.
The good or evil of trouble is always determined by
the spirit in which it is received. Trouble proves a
blessing or a curse, just according as it is received
and treated by us. It either softens or hardens us.
It either draws us to prayer and to God or it drives
us from God and from the closet. Trouble hardened
Pharaoh till finally it had no effect on him,
only to make him more desperate and to drive him
farther from God. The same sun softens the wax
and hardens the clay. The same sun melts the ice
and dries out the moisture from the earth.</p>

<p>As is the infinite variety of trouble, so also is
there infinite variety in the relations of prayer to
other things. How many are the things which are
the subject of prayer! It has to do with everything
which concerns us, with everybody with whom we
have to do, and has to do with all times. But especially
does prayer have to do with trouble. “This
poor man cried and the Lord heard him, and saved
him out of all his troubles.” O the blessedness, the
help, the comfort of prayer in the day of trouble!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
And how marvelous the promises of God to us in
the time of trouble!</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore
will I deliver him; I will set him on high because he
hath known my name. He shall call upon me, and I
will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will
deliver him and honor him.”</p>

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>How rich in its sweetness, how far-reaching in
the realm of trouble, and how cheering to faith, are
the words of promise which God delivers to His
believing, praying ones, by the mouth of Isaiah:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not:

waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers,
they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest
through the fire, thou shalt not be burned: neither
shall the flame kindle upon thee…. For I am the
Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour.”</p>

<h4>PRAYER AND TROUBLE (<i>Continued</i>)
</h4>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“My first message for heavenly relief went singing over
millions of miles of space in 1869, and brought relief to my
troubled heart. But, thanks be to Him, I have received many
delightful and helpful answers during the last fifty years. I
would think the commerce of the skies had gone into bankruptcy
if I did not hear frequently, since I have learned how
to ask and how to receive.”—<span class="smcap">Rev. H. W. Hodge.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="p2 drop-cap">I<span class="smcap">n</span> the New Testament there are three words
used which embrace trouble. These are tribulation,
suffering and affliction, words differing
somewhat, and yet each of them practically meaning
trouble of some kind. Our Lord put His disciples
on notice that they might expect tribulation in this
life, teaching them that tribulation belonged to this
world, and they could not hope to escape it; that
they would not be carried through this life on flowery
beds of ease. How hard to learn this plain and
patent lesson! “In the world ye shall have tribulation;
but be of good cheer; I have overcome the
world.” There is the encouragement. As He had
overcome the world and its tribulations, so might
they do the same.</p>

<p>Paul taught the same lesson throughout his ministry,
when in confirming the souls of the brethren,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
and exhorting them to continue in the faith, he told
them that “we must, through much tribulation,
enter into the kingdom of God.” He himself knew
this by his own experience, for his pathway was
anything but smooth and flowery.</p>

<p>He it is who uses the word “suffering” to describe
the troubles of life, in that comforting passage
in which he contrasts life’s troubles with
the final glory of heaven, which shall be the reward
of all who patiently endure the ills of Divine
Providence:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“For I reckon that the sufferings of this present
time are not worthy to be compared with the glory
which shall be revealed in us.”</p>
</div>

<p>And he it is who speaks of the afflictions which
come to the people of God in this world, and regards
them as light as compared with the weight of glory
awaiting all who are submissive, patient and faithful
in all their troubles:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“For our light affliction, which is but for a
moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and
eternal weight of glory.”</p>
</div>

<p>But these present afflictions can work for us only
as we co-operate with God in prayer. As God
works through prayer, it is only through this means
He can accomplish His highest ends for us. His
Providence works with greatest effect with His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
praying ones. These know the uses of trouble
and its gracious designs. The greatest value in
trouble comes to those who bow lowest before the
throne.</p>

<p>Paul, in urging patience in tribulation, connects
it directly with prayer, as if prayer alone would
place us where we could be patient when tribulation
comes. “Rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation,
continuing instant in prayer.” He here couples up
tribulation and prayer, showing their close relationship
and the worth of prayer in begetting and culturing
patience in tribulation. In fact there can be
no patience exemplified when trouble comes, only as
it is secured through instant and continued prayer.
In the school of prayer is where patience is learned
and practiced.</p>

<p>Prayer brings us into that state of grace where
tribulation is not only endured, but where there is
under it a spirit of rejoicing. In showing the gracious
benefits of justification, in Romans 5:3, Paul
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“And not only so, but we glory in tribulation also:
knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience,
experience; and experience, hope; and hope
maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed
abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given
unto us.”</p>
</div>

<p>What a chain of graces are here set forth
as flowing from tribulation! What successive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
steps to a high state of religious experience!
And what rich fruits result from even painful
tribulation!</p>

<p>To the same effect are the words of Peter in his
First Epistle, in his strong prayer for those Christians
to whom he writes; thus showing that suffering
and the highest state of grace are closely connected;
and intimating that it is through suffering
we are to be brought to those higher regions of
Christian experience:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“But the God of all grace, who hath called us into
his eternal glory, by Christ Jesus, after that ye have
suffered awhile, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen
and settle you.”</p>
</div>

<p>It is in the fires of suffering that God purifies
His saints and brings them to the highest things.
It is in the furnace their faith is tested, their patience
is tried, and they are developed in all those
rich virtues which make up Christian character. It
is while they are passing through deep waters that
He shows how close He can come to His praying,
believing saints.</p>

<p>It takes faith of a high order and a Christian experience
far above the average religion of this day,
to count it joy when we are called to pass through
tribulation. God’s highest aim in dealing with His
people is in developing Christian character. He is
after begetting in us those rich virtues which belong
to our Lord Jesus Christ. He is seeking to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
make us like Himself. It is not so much work that
He wants in us. It is not greatness. It is the presence
in us of patience, meekness, submission to the
Divine will, prayerfulness which brings everything
to Him. He seeks to beget His own image in us.
And trouble in some form tends to do this very
thing, for this is the end and aim of trouble. This
is its work. This is the task it is called to perform.
It is not a chance incident in life, but has a design
in view, just as it has an All-wise Designer back of
it, who makes trouble His agent to bring forth the
largest results.</p>

<p>The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews gives
us a perfect directory of trouble, comprehensive,
clear and worth while to be studied. Here is “chastisement,”
another word for trouble, coming from
a Father’s hand, showing God is in all the sad and
afflictive events of life. Here is its nature and its
gracious design. It is not punishment in the accurate
meaning of that word, but the means God employs
to correct and discipline His children in
dealing with them on earth. Then we have the fact
of the evidence of being His people, namely, the
presence of chastisement. The ultimate end is that
we “may be partakers of his holiness,” which is but
another way of saying that all this disciplinary
process is to the end that God may make us like
Himself. What an encouragement, too, that, chastisement
is no evidence of anger or displeasure on
God’s part, but is the strong proof of His love. Let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
us read the entire directory on this important
subject:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“And ye have forgotten the exhortation which
speaketh unto you as unto children. My son, despise
not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when
thou art rebuked of him: For whom the Lord loveth
he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.
If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with
you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father
chasteneth not? But if ye are without chastisement,
whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards and
not sons.</p>

<p>“Furthermore, we have had fathers of our flesh
which corrected us, and we gave them reverence:
shall we not much rather be in subjection to the
Father of spirits and live? For they verily for a few
days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he
for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.
Now no chastening for the present seemeth to
be joyous, but grievous; nevertheless, afterward it
yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness to them
which are exercised thereby.”</p>
</div>

<p>Just as prayer is wide in its range, taking in
everything, so trouble is infinitely varied in its uses
and designs. It takes trouble sometimes to arrest
attention, to stop men in the busy rush of life, and
to awaken them to a sense of their helplessness
and their need and sinfulness. Not till King
Manasseh was bound with thorns and carried
away into a foreign land and got into deep trouble,
was he awakened and brought back to God. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
was then he humbled himself and began to call
upon God.</p>

<p>The Prodigal Son was independent and self-sufficient
when in prosperity, but when money and
friends departed, and he began to be in want, then
it was he “came to himself,” and decided to return
to his father’s house, with prayer and confession on
his lips. Many a man who has forgotten God has
been arrested, caused to consider his ways, and
brought to remember God and pray by trouble.
Blessed is trouble when it accomplishes this in men!</p>

<p>It is for this among other reasons that Job says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth.
Therefore, despise not thou the chastening of the
Almighty. For he maketh sore, and bindeth up; he
woundeth, and his hands maketh whole. He shall
deliver thee in six troubles; yea, in seven there shall
no evil touch thee.”</p>
</div>

<p>One thing more might be named. Trouble makes
earth undesirable and causes heaven to loom up
large in the horizon of hope. There is a world
where trouble never comes. But the path of tribulation
leads to that world. Those who are there
went there through tribulation. What a world set
before our longing eyes which appeals to our
hopes, as sorrows like a cyclone sweep over us!
Hear John, as he talks about it and those who
are there:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“What are these which are arrayed in white robes?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
and whence came they?… And he said to me,
These are they which came out of great tribulation,
and have washed their robes and made them white
in the blood of the Lamb…. And God shall wipe
away all tears from their eyes.”</p>
</div>

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Oh, children of God, ye who have suffered, who
have been sorely tried, whose sad experiences have
often brought broken spirits and bleeding hearts,
cheer up! God is in all your troubles, and He will
see that all shall “work together for good,” if you

son had been answered at the time she set for herself, the
nation might never have known the mighty man of God it
found in Samuel. Hannah wanted only a son, but God
wanted more. He wanted a prophet, and a saviour, and a
ruler for His people. Some one said that ‘God had to get a
woman before He could get a man.’ This woman He got in
Hannah precisely by those weeks and months and years there
came a woman with a vision like God’s, with tempered soul
and gentle spirit and a seasoned will, prepared to be the kind
of a mother for the kind of a man God knew the nation
needed.”—<span class="smcap">W. E. Biederwolf.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="p2 drop-cap">G<span class="smcap">od</span> has a great work on hand in this
world. This work is involved in the plan
of salvation. It embraces redemption and
providence. God is governing this world, with its
intelligent beings, for His own glory and for their
good. What, then, is God’s work in this world?
Rather what is the end He seeks in His great work?
It is nothing short of holiness of heart and life in
the children of fallen Adam. Man is a fallen creature,
born with an evil nature, with an evil bent,
unholy propensities, sinful desires, wicked inclinations.
Man is unholy by nature, born so. “They
go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
God’s entire plan is to take hold of fallen man and
to seek to change him and make him holy. God’s
work is to make holy men out of unholy men. This
is the very end of Christ coming into the world:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“For this purpose was the Son of God manifested
that he might destroy the works of the devil.”</p>
</div>

<p>God is holy in nature and in all His ways, and He
wants to make man like Himself.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“As he who hath called you is holy, so be ye holy
in all manner of conversation; because it is written,
Be ye holy, for I am holy.”</p>
</div>

<p>This is being Christlike. This is following Jesus
Christ. This is the aim of all Christian effort.
This is the earnest, heartfelt desire of every truly
regenerated soul. This is what is to be constantly
and earnestly prayed for. It is that we may be
made holy. Not that we must make ourselves holy,
but we must be cleansed from all sin by the precious
atoning blood of Christ, and be made holy by the
direct agency of the Holy Spirit. Not that we are
to <em>do</em> holy, but rather to <em>be</em> holy. Being must precede
doing. First be, then do. First, obtain a holy
heart, then live a holy life. And for this high and
gracious end God has made the most ample provisions
in the atoning work of our Lord and
through the agency of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>The work of God in the world is the implantation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
the growth and the perfection of holiness in
His people. Keep this ever in mind. But we might
ask just now, Is this work advancing in the Church?
Are men and women being made holy? Is the
present-day Church engaged in the business of
making holy men and women? This is not a vain
and speculative question. It is practical, pertinent
and all important.</p>

<p>The present-day Church has vast machinery.
Her activities are great, and her material prosperity
is unparalleled. The name of religion is widely-spread
and well-known. Much money comes into
the Lord’s treasury and is paid out. But here is
the question: Does the work of holiness keep pace
with all this? Is the burden of the prayers of
Church people to be made holy? Are our preachers
really holy men? Or to go back a little further,
are they hungering and thirsting after righteousness,
desiring the sincere milk of the Word that
they may grow thereby? Are they really seeking to
be holy men? Of course men of intelligence are
greatly needed in the pulpit, but prior to that, and
primary to it, is the fact that we need holy men to
stand before dying men and proclaim the salvation
of God to them.</p>

<p>Ministers, like laymen, and no more so than laymen,
must be holy men in life, in conversation and
in temper. They must be examples to the flock of
God in all things. By their lives they are to preach
as well as to speak. Men in the pulpit are needed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
who are spotless in life, circumspect in behaviour,
“without rebuke and blameless in the midst of a
crooked and perverse nation, among whom they are
to shine in the world.” Are our preachers of this
type of men? We are simply asking the question.
Let the reader make up his own judgment. Is the
work of holiness making progress among our
preachers?</p>

<p>Again let us ask: Are our leading laymen examples
of holiness? Are they seeking holiness of
heart and life? Are they praying men, ever praying
that God would fashion them according to His
pattern of holiness? Are their business ways without
stain of sin, and their gains free from the taint
of wrong-doing? Have they the foundation of
solid honesty, and does uprightness bring them into
elevation and influence? Does business integrity
and probity run parallel with religious activity, and
with churchly observance?</p>

<p>Then, while we are pursuing our investigation,
seeking light as to whether the work of God among
His people is making progress, let us ask further as
to our women. Are the leading women of our
churches dead to the fashions of this world, separated
from the world, not conformed to the world’s
maxims and customs? Are they in behaviour as
becometh holiness, teaching the young women by
word and life the lessons of soberness, obedience,
and home-keeping? Are our women noted for their
praying habits? Are they patterns of prayer?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
How searching are all these questions? And
will any one dare say they are impertinent and out
of place? If God’s work be to make men and
women holy, and He has made ample provisions in
the law of prayer of doing this very thing, why
should it be thought impertinent and useless to propound
such personal and pointed questions as these?
They have to do directly with the work and with its
progress and its perfection. They go to the very
seat of the disease. They hit the spot.</p>

<p>We might as well face the situation first as last.
There is no use to shut our eyes to real facts. If
the Church does not do this sort of work—if the
Church does not advance its members in holiness of
heart and life—then all our show of activities and
all our display of Church work are a delusion and
a snare.</p>

<p>But let us ask as to another large and important
class of people in our churches. They are the hope
of the future Church. To them all eyes are turned.
Are our young men and women growing in sober-mindedness
and reverence, and in all those graces
which have their root in the renewed heart, which
mark solid and permanent advance in the Divine
life? If we are not growing in holiness, then we
are doing nothing religious nor abiding.</p>

<p>Material prosperity is not the infallible sign of
spiritual prosperity. The former may exist while
the latter is significantly absent. Material prosperity
may easily blind the eyes of Church leaders, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
much so that they will make it a substitute for spiritual
prosperity. How great the need to watch at
that point! Prosperity in money matters does not
signify growth in holiness. The seasons of material
prosperity are rarely seasons of spiritual advance,
either to the individual or to the Church.
It is so easy to lose sight of God when goods increase.
It <a id="chg1"></a>is so easy to lean on human agencies and
cease praying and relying upon God when material
prosperity comes to the Church.</p>

<p>If it be contended that the work of God is progressing,
and that we are growing in holiness, then
some perplexing questions arise which will be hard
to answer. If the Church is making advances on
the lines of deep spirituality—if we are a praying
people, noted for our prayer habits—if our people
are hungering after holiness—then let us ask, why
do we now have so few mighty outpourings of the
Holy Spirit on our chief churches and our principal
appointments? Why is it that so few of our revivals
spring from the life of the pastor, who is
noted for his deep spirituality, or the life of our
church? Is the Lord’s hand shortened that He cannot
save? Is His ear heavy that He cannot hear?
Why is it that in order to have so-called revivals,
we must have outside pressure, by the reputation
and sensation of some renowned evangelist? This
is largely true in our larger charges and with our
leading men. Why is it that the pastor is not sufficiently
spiritual, holy and in communion with God,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
that he cannot hold his own revival services, and
have large outpourings of the Holy Spirit on the
Church, the community and upon himself? There
can be but one solution for all this state of things.
We have cultivated other things to the neglect of the
work of holiness. We have permitted our minds to
be pre-occupied with material things in the Church.
Unfortunately, whether designedly or not, we have
substituted the external for the internal. We have
put that which is seen to the front and shut out that
which is unseen. It is all too true as to the Church,
that we are much further advanced in material matters
than in matters spiritual.</p>

<p>But the cause of this sad state of things may be
traced further back. It is largely due to the decay
of prayer. For with the decline of the work of
holiness there has come the decline of the business
of praying. As praying and holiness go together,
so the decline of one, means the decay of the other.
Excuse it if we may, justify the present state of
things if we will, yet it is all too patent that the emphasis
in the work of the present-day Church is not
put on prayer. And just as this has occurred, the
emphasis has been taken from the great work of
God set on foot in the atonement, holiness of heart
and life. The Church is not turning out praying
men and women, because the Church is not intently
engaged in the one great work of holiness.</p>

<p>At one time, John Wesley saw that there was a
perceptible decline in the work of holiness, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
stopped short to inquire into the cause, and if we
are as honest and spiritual as he was, we will now
see the same causes operating to stay God’s work
among us. In a letter to his brother, Charles, at
one time, he comes directly to the point, and makes
short, incisive work of it. Here is how he begins
his letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“What has hindered the work? I want to consider
this. And must we not first say, we are the chief. If
we were more holy in heart and life, thoroughly devoted
to God, would not all the preachers catch fire,
and carry it with them, throughout the land?</p>

<p>“Is not the next hindrance the littleness of grace
(rather than of gifts) in a considerable part of our
preachers? They have not the whole mind that was
in Christ. They do not steadily walk as He walked.
And, therefore, the hand of the Lord is stayed, though
not altogether; though He does work still. But it is
not in such a degree as He surely would, were they
holy as He that hath sent them is holy.</p>

<p>“Is not the third hindrance the littleness of grace
in the generality of our people? Therefore, they pray
little, and with little fervency for a general blessing.
And, therefore, their prayer has little power with God.
It does not, as once, shut and open heaven.</p>

<p>“Add to this, that as there is much of the spirit of
the world in their hearts, so there is much conformity
to the world in their lives. They ought to be bright
and shining lights, but they neither burn nor shine.
They are not true to the rules they profess to observe.
They are not holy in all manner of conversation.
Nay, many of them are salt that has lost its savour,
the little savour they once had. Wherewith then shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
the rest of the land be seasoned? What wonder that
their neighbours are as unholy as ever?”</p>
</div>

<p>He strikes the spot. He hits the centre. He
grades the cause. He freely confesses that he and
Charles are the first cause, in this decline of holiness.
The chief ones occupy positions of responsibility.
As they go, so goes the Church. They give
colour to the Church. They largely determine its
character and its work. What holiness should mark
these chief men? What zeal should ever characterise
them? What prayerfulness should be seen in
them! How influential they ought to be with God!
If the head be weak, then the whole body will feel
the stroke.</p>

<p>The pastors come next in his catalogue. When
the chief shepherds and those who are under
them, the immediate pastors, stay their advance
in holiness, the panic will reach to the end of the
line. As are the pastors, so will the people be as
a rule. If the pastors are prayerless, then will the
people follow in their footsteps. If the preacher
be silent upon the work of holiness, then will there
be no hungering and thirsting after holiness in the
laymen. If the preacher be careless about obtaining
the highest and best God has for him in
religious experience, then will the people take
after him.</p>

<p>One statement of Wesley needs to be repeated
with emphasis. The littleness of grace, rather than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
the smallness of gifts,—this is largely the case with
the preachers. It may be stated as an axiom: That
the work of God fails as a general rule, more for
the lack of grace, than for the want of gifts. It is
more than this. It is more than this, for a full supply
of grace brings an increase of gifts. It may be
repeated that small results, a low experience, a low
religious life, and pointless, powerless preaching
always flow from a lack of grace. And a lack of
grace flows from a lack of praying. Great grace
comes from great praying.</p>

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>In carrying on His great work in the world, God
works through human agents. He works through
His Church collectively and through His people individually.
In order that they may be effective
agents, they must be “vessels unto honour, sanctified,
and meet for the Master’s use, and prepared
unto every good work.” God works most effectively
through holy men. His work makes progress
in the hands of praying men. Peter tells us that
husbands who might not be reached by the Word of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
God, might be won by the conversation of their
wives. It is those who are “blameless and harmless,
the sons of God,” who can hold forth the word
of life “in the midst of a crooked and perverse
nation.”</p>

<p>The world judges religion not by what the Bible
says, but by how Christians live. Christians are the
Bible which sinners read. These are the epistles to
be read of all men. “By their fruits ye shall know
them.” The emphasis, then, is to be placed upon
holiness of life. But unfortunately in the present-day
Church, emphasis has been placed elsewhere.
In selecting Church workers and choosing ecclesiastical
officers, the quality of holiness is not considered.
The praying fitness seems not to be taken
into account, when it was just otherwise in all of
God’s movements and in all of His plans. He
looked for holy men, those noted for their praying
habits. Prayer leaders are scarce. Prayer conduct
is not counted as the highest qualification for offices
in the Church.</p>

<p>We cannot wonder that so little is accomplished
in the great work in the world which God has in
hand. The fact is that it is surprising so much
has been done with such feeble, defective agents.
“Holiness to the Lord” needs again to be written
on the banners of the Church. Once more it needs
to be sounded out in the ears of modern Christians.
“Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without
which no man shall see the Lord.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
Let it be iterated and reiterated that this is the
Divine standard of religion. Nothing short of this
will satisfy the Divine requirement. O the danger
of deception at this point! How near one can come
to being right and yet be wrong! Some men can
come very near to pronouncing the test word,
“Shibboleth,” but they miss it. “Many will say
unto me. Lord, Lord, in that day,” says Jesus
Christ, but He further states that then will He say
unto them, “I never knew you; depart from me, ye
that work iniquity.”</p>

<p>Men can do many good things and yet not be holy
in heart and righteous in conduct. They can do
many good things and lack that spiritual quality of
heart called holiness. How great the need of hearing
the words of Paul guarding us against self-deception
in the great work of personal salvation:</p>

a man soweth, that shall he also reap.”</p>

<h4>PRAYER AND CONSECRATION
</h4>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Eudamidas, a citizen of Corinth, died in poverty; but
having two wealthy friends, Arctæus and Carixenus, left the
following testament: In virtue of my last will, I bequeath to
Arctæus my mother and to Charixenus my daughter to be
taken home to their houses and supported for the remainder
of their lives. This testament occasioned much mirth and
laughter. The two legatees were pleased and affectionately
executed the will. If heathens trusted each other, why should
not I cherish a far greater confidence in my beloved Master,
Jesus? I hereby, therefore, nominate Him my sole heir, consigning
to Him my soul and my children and sisters, that He
may adopt, protect, and provide for them by His mighty
power unto salvation. The whole residue of the estate shall
be entrusted to His holy counsel.”—<span class="smcap">Gotthold.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="p2 drop-cap">W<span class="smcap">hen</span> we study the many-sidedness of
prayer, we are surprised at the number
of things with which it is connected.
There is no phase of human life which it does not
affect, and it has to do with everything affecting
human salvation. Prayer and consecration are
closely related. Prayer leads up to, and governs
consecration. Prayer is precedent to consecration,
accompanies it, and is a direct result of it. Much
goes under the name of consecration which has no
consecration in it. Much consecration of the present
day is defective, superficial and spurious, worth
nothing so far as the office and ends of consecration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
are concerned. Popular consecration is
sadly at fault because it has little or no prayer in
it. No consecration is worth a thought which is
not the direct fruit of much praying, and which
fails to bring one into a life of prayer. Prayer is
the one thing prominent in a consecrated life.</p>

<p>Consecration is much more than a life of so-called
service. It is a life of personal holiness, first
of all. It is that which brings spiritual power into
the heart and enlivens the entire inner man. It is a
life which ever recognises God, and a life given up
to true prayer.</p>

<p>Full consecration is the highest type of a Christian
life. It is the one Divine standard of experience,
of living and of service. It is the one thing at
which the believer should aim. Nothing short of
entire consecration must satisfy him.</p>

<p>Never is he to be contented till he is fully, entirely
the Lord’s by his own consent. His praying
naturally and involuntarily leads up to this one act
of his.</p>

<p>Consecration is the voluntary set dedication of
one’s self to God, an offering definitely made, and
made without any reservation whatever. It is the
setting apart of all we are, all we have, and all we
expect to have or be, to God first of all. It is not
so much the giving of ourselves to the Church, or
the mere engaging in some one line of Church
work. Almighty God is in view and He is the end
of all consecration. It is a separation of one’s self<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
to God, a devotement of all that he is and has to a
sacred use. Some things may be devoted to a special
purpose, but it is not consecration in the true
sense. Consecration has a sacred nature. It is devoted
to holy ends. It is the voluntary putting of
one’s self in God’s hands to be used sacredly, holily,
with sanctifying ends in view.</p>

<p>Consecration is not so much the setting one’s
self apart from sinful things and wicked ends, but
rather it is the separation from worldly, secular and
even legitimate things, if they come in conflict with
God’s plans, to holy uses. It is the devoting of all
we have to God for His own specific use. It is a
separation from things questionable, or even legitimate,
when the choice is to be made between the
things of this life and the claims of God.</p>

<p>The consecration which meets God’s demands
and which He accepts is to be full, complete, with
no mental reservation, with nothing withheld. It
cannot be partial, any more than a whole burnt
offering in Old Testament times could have been
partial. The whole animal had to be offered in
sacrifice. To reserve any part of the animal would
have seriously vitiated the offering. So to make a
half-hearted, partial consecration is to make no consecration
at all, and is to fail utterly in securing the
Divine acceptance. It involves our whole being, all
we have and all that we are. Everything is definitely
and voluntarily placed in God’s hands for His
supreme use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
Consecration is not all there is in holiness. Many
make serious mistakes at this point. Consecration
makes us relatively holy. We are holy only in the
sense that we are now closely related to God, in
which we were not related heretofore. Consecration
is the human side of holiness. In this sense, it
is self-sanctification, and only in this sense. Sanctification
or holiness in its truest and highest sense is
Divine, the act of the Holy Spirit working in the
heart, making it clean and putting therein in a
higher degree the fruits of the Spirit.</p>

<p>This distinction is clearly set forth and kept in
view by Moses in “Leviticus,” wherein he shows
the human and the Divine side of sanctification or
holiness:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Sanctify yourselves, therefore, and be ye holy, for
I am the Lord your God. And ye shall keep my statutes
and do them; I am the Lord which sanctify you.”</p>
</div>

<p>Here we are to sanctify ourselves, and then in
the next word we are taught that it is the Lord
which sanctifies us. God does not consecrate us to
His service. We do not sanctify ourselves in this
highest sense. Here is the two-fold meaning of
sanctification, and a distinction which needs to be
always kept in mind.</p>

<p>Consecration being the intelligent, voluntary act
of the believer, this act is the direct result of praying.
No prayerless man ever conceives the idea of
a full consecration. Prayerlessness and consecration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
have nothing whatever in common. A life of
prayer naturally leads up to full consecration. It
leads nowhere else. In fact, a life of prayer is satisfied
with nothing else but an entire dedication of
one’s self to God. Consecration recognises fully
God’s ownership to us. It cheerfully assents to the
truth set forth by Paul:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Ye are not your own. For ye are bought with a
price. Therefore, glorify God in your body and spirit,
which are God’s.”</p>
</div>

<p>And true praying leads that way. It cannot reach
any other destination. It is bound to run into this
depot. This is its natural result. This is the sort
of work which praying turns out. Praying makes
consecrated people. It cannot make any other sort.
It drives to this end. It aims at this very purpose.</p>

<p>As prayer leads up to and brings forth full consecration,
so prayer entirely impregnates a consecrated
life. The prayer life and the consecrated life
are intimate companions. They are Siamese twins,
inseparable. Prayer enters into every phase of a
consecrated life. A prayerless life which claims
consecration is a misnomer, false, counterfeit.</p>

<p>Consecration is really the setting apart of one’s
self to a life of prayer. It means not only to pray,
but to pray habitually, and to pray more effectually.
It is the consecrated man who accomplishes most by
His praying. God must hear the man wholly given
up to God. God cannot deny the requests of him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
who has renounced all claims to himself, and who
has wholly dedicated himself to God and His service.
This act of the consecrated man puts him “on
praying ground and pleading terms” with God. It
puts Him in reach of God in prayer. It places him
where he can get hold of God, and where he can
influence God to do things which He would not
otherwise do. Consecration brings answers to
prayer. God can depend upon consecrated men.
God can afford to commit Himself in prayer to
those who have fully committed themselves to God.
He who gives all to God will get all from God.
Having given all to God, he can claim all that
God has for him.</p>

<p>As prayer is the condition of full consecration, so
prayer is the habit, the rule, of him who has dedicated
himself wholly to God. Prayer is becoming
in the consecrated life. Prayer is no strange thing
in such a life. There is a peculiar affinity between
prayer and consecration, for both recognise God,
both submit to God, and both have their aim and
end in God. Prayer is part and parcel of the consecrated
life. Prayer is the constant, the inseparable,
the intimate companion of consecration. They
walk and talk together.</p>

<p>There is much talk today of consecration, and
many are termed consecrated people who know not
the alphabet of it. Much modern consecration falls
far below the Scripture standard. There is really
no real consecration in it. Just as there is much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
praying without any real prayer in it, so there is
much so-called consecration current, today, in the
Church which has no real consecration in it. Much
passes for consecration in the Church which receives
the praise and plaudits of superficial, formal
professors, but which is wide of the mark. There
is much hurrying to and fro, here and there, much
fuss and feathers, much going about and doing
many things, and those who busy themselves after
this fashion are called consecrated men and women.
The central trouble with all this false consecration
is that there is no prayer in it, nor is it in any sense
the direct result of praying. People can do many
excellent and commendable things in the Church and
be utter strangers to a life of consecration, just as
they can do many things and be prayerless.</p>

<p>Here is the true test of consecration. It is a life
of prayer. Unless prayer be pre-eminent, unless
prayer is to the front, the consecration is faulty,
deceptive, falsely named. Does he pray? That is
the test-question of every so-called consecrated man.
Is he a man of prayer? No consecration is worth a
thought if it be devoid of prayer. Yea, more—if it
be not pre-eminently and primarily a life of prayer.</p>

<p>God wants consecrated men because they can pray
and will pray. He can use consecrated men because
He can use praying men. As prayerless men are in
His way, hinder Him, and prevent the success of
His cause, so likewise unconsecrated men are useless
to Him, and hinder Him in carrying out His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
gracious plans, and in executing His noble purposes
in redemption. God wants consecrated men because
He wants praying men. Consecration and
prayer meet in the same man. Prayer is the tool
with which the consecrated man works. Consecrated
men are the agents through whom prayer
works. Prayer helps the consecrated man in maintaining
his attitude of consecration, keeps him alive
to God, and aids him in doing the work to which
he is called and to which he has given himself.
Consecration helps to effectual praying. Consecration
enables one to get the most out of his praying.</p>

<p>We must insist upon it that the prime purpose of
consecration is not service in the ordinary sense of
that word. Service in the minds of not a few
means nothing more than engaging in some of the
many forms of modern Church activities. There
are a multitude of such activities, enough to engage
the time and mind of any one, yea, even more than
enough. Some of these may be good, others not so
good. The present-day Church is filled with machinery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
organisations, committees and societies, so
much so that the power it has is altogether insufficient
to run the machinery, or to furnish life
sufficient to do all this external work. Consecration
has a much higher and nobler end than merely to
expend itself in these external things.</p>

<p>Consecration aims at the right sort of service—the
Scriptural kind. It seeks to serve God, but in
entirely a different sphere than that which is in the
minds of present-day Church leaders and workers.
The very first sort of service mentioned by Zachariah,
father of John the Baptist, in his wonderful
prophecy and statement in Luke 1:74, was thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“That he would grant unto us, that we, being delivered
out of the hand of our enemies, might serve
him without fear, in holiness and righteousness, all
the days of our life.”</p>
</div>

<p>Here we have the idea of “serving God in holiness
and righteousness all the days of our life.”</p>

<p>And the same kind of service is mentioned in
Luke’s strong tribute to the father and mother of
John the Baptist before the latter’s birth:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“And they were both righteous before God, walking
in all the commandments and ordinances of the
Lord blameless.”</p>
</div>

<p>And Paul, in writing to the Philippians, strikes
the same keynote in putting the emphasis on blamelessness
of life:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
<p>“Do all things without murmurings and disputings,
that ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of
God without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and
perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the
world; holding forth the word of life.”</p>
</div>

<p>We must mention a truth which is strangely
overlooked in these days by what are called personal
workers, that in the Epistles of Paul and others, it
is not what are called Church activities which are
brought to the front, but rather the personal life.
It is good behaviour, righteous conduct, holy living,
godly conversation, right tempers—things which
belong primarily to the personal life in religion.
Everywhere this is emphasised, put in the forefront,
made much of and insisted on. Religion first of all
puts one to living right. Religion shows itself in
the life. Thus is religion to prove its reality, its
sincerity and its Divinity.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0a">“So let our lips and lives express</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The first great end of consecration is holiness of
heart and of life. It is to glorify God, and this can
be done in no more effectual way than by a holy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
life flowing from a heart cleansed from all sin. The
great burden of heart pressed on every one who
becomes a Christian lies right here. This he is to
ever keep in mind, and to further this kind of life
and this kind of heart, he is to watch, to pray, and
to bend all his diligence in using all the means of
grace. He who is truly and fully consecrated, lives
a holy life. He seeks after holiness of heart. Is not
satisfied without it. For this very purpose he consecrates
himself to God. He gives himself entirely
over to God in order to be holy in heart and in life.</p>

<p>As holiness of heart and of life is thoroughly impregnated
with prayer, so consecration and prayer
are closely allied in personal religion. It takes
prayer to bring one into such a consecrated life of
holiness to the Lord, and it takes prayer to maintain
such a life. Without much prayer, such a life of
holiness will break down. Holy people are praying
people. Holiness of heart and life puts people to
praying. Consecration puts people to praying in
earnest.</p>

<p>Prayerless people are strangers to anything like
holiness of heart and cleanness of heart. Those
who are unfamiliar with the closet are not at all
interested in consecration and holiness. Holiness
thrives in the place of secret prayer. The environments
of the closet of prayer are favourable to its
being and its culture. In the closet holiness is
found. Consecration brings one into holiness of
heart, and prayer stands hard by when it is done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
The spirit of consecration is the spirit of prayer.
The law of consecration is the law of prayer. Both
laws work in perfect harmony without the slightest
jar or discord. Consecration is the practical expression
of true prayer. People who are consecrated
are known by their praying habits. Consecration
thus expresses itself in prayer. He who is not interested
in prayer has no interest in consecration.
Prayer creates an interest in consecration, then
prayer brings one into a state of heart where consecration
is a subject of delight, bringing joy of heart,
satisfaction of soul, contentment of spirit. The
consecrated soul is the happiest soul. There is no
friction whatever between him who is fully given
over to God and God’s will. There is perfect harmony
between the will of such a man and God, and
His will. And the two wills being in perfect accord,
this brings rest of soul, absence of friction, and the
presence of perfect peace.</p>

<h4>PRAYER AND A DEFINITE RELIGIOUS
STANDARD
</h4>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The Angel Gabriel described Him as ‘that holy thing’
before He was born. As He was, so are we, in our measure,
in this world.”—<span class="smcap">Dr. Alexander Whyte.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="p2 drop-cap">M<span class="smcap">uch</span> of the feebleness, barrenness and
paucity of religion results from the failure
to have a Scriptural and reasonable
standard in religion, by which to shape character
and measure results; and this largely results from
the omission of prayer or the failure to put prayer
in the standard. We cannot possibly mark our advances
in religion if there is no point to which we
are definitely advancing. Always there must be
something definite before the mind’s eye at which
we are aiming and to which we are driving. We
cannot contrast shapeliness with unshapeliness if
there be no pattern after which to model. Neither
can there be inspiration if there be no high end to
stimulate us.</p>

<p>Many Christians are disjointed and aimless because
they have no pattern before them after which
conduct and character are to be shaped. They just
move on aimlessly, their minds in a cloudy state,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
no pattern in view, no point in sight, no standard
after which they are striving. There is no standard
by which to value and gauge their efforts. No
magnet is there to fill their eyes, quicken their steps,
and to draw them and keep them steady.</p>

<p>All this vague idea of religion grows out of loose
notions about prayer. That which helps to make
the standard of religion clear and definite is prayer.
That which aids in placing that standard high is
prayer. The praying ones are those who have
something definite in view. In fact prayer itself is
a very definite thing, aims at something specific, and
has a mark at which it aims. Prayer aims at the
most definite, the highest and the sweetest religious
experience. The praying ones want all that God
has in store for them. They are not satisfied with
anything like a low religious life, superficial, vague
and indefinite. The praying ones are not only after
a “deeper work of grace,” but want the very deepest
work of grace possible and promised. They are
not after being saved from some sin, but saved from
all sin, both inward and outward. They are after
not only deliverance from sinning, but from sin
itself, from its being, its power and its pollution.
They are after holiness of heart and life.</p>

<p>Prayer believes in, and seeks for the very highest
religious life set before us in the Word of God.
Prayer is the condition of that life. Prayer points
out the only pathway to such a life. The standard
of a religious life is the standard of prayer. Prayer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
is so vital, so essential, so far-reaching, that it enters
into all religion, and sets the standard clear and definite
before the eye. The degree of our estimate of
prayer fixes our ideas of the standard of a religious
life. The standard of Bible religion is the standard
of prayer. The more there is of prayer in the life,
the more definite and the higher our notions of
religion.</p>

<p>The Scriptures alone make the standard of life
and experience. When we make our own standard,
there is delusion and falsity for our desires, convenience
and pleasure form the rule, and that is always
a fleshly and a low rule. From it, all the fundamental
principles of a Christly religion are left out.
Whatever standard of religion which makes in it
provision for the flesh, is unscriptural and hurtful.</p>

<p>Nor will it do to leave it to others to fix the
standard of religion for us. When we allow others
to make our standard of religion, it is generally
deficient because in imitation, defects are transferred
to the imitator more readily than virtues, and
a second edition of a man is marred by its defects.</p>

<p>The most serious damage in thus determining
what religion is by what others say, is in allowing
current opinion, the contagion of example, the grade
of religion current among us, to shape our religious
opinions and characters. Adoniram Judson once
wrote to a friend, “Let me beg you, not to rest contented
with the commonplace religion that is now
so prevalent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
Commonplace religion is pleasing to flesh and
blood. There is no self-denial in it, no cross bearing,
no self-crucifixion. It is good enough for our
neighbours. Why should we be singular and
straight-laced? Others are living on a low plane,
on a compromising level, living as the world lives.
Why should we be peculiar, zealous of good works?
Why should we fight to win heaven while so many
are sailing there on “flowery beds of ease”? Are
the easy-going, careless, sauntering crowd, living
prayerless lives, going to heaven? Is heaven a fit
place for non-praying, loose living, ease loving
people? That is the supreme question.</p>

<p>Paul gives the following caution about making
for ourselves the jolly, pleasure-seeking religious
company all about us the standard of our measurement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or
compare ourselves with some that commend themselves;
but they, measuring themselves by themselves,
and comparing themselves among themselves, are not
wise. But we will not boast of things without our
measure, but according to the measure of the rule
which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach
even unto you.”</p>
</div>

<p>No standard of religion is worth a moment’s consideration
which leaves prayer out of the account.
No standard is worth any thought which does not
make prayer the main thing in religion. So necessary
is prayer, so fundamental in God’s plan, so all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
important to everything like a religious life, that it
enters into all Bible religion. Prayer itself is a
standard, definite, emphatic, Scriptural. A life of
prayer is the Divine rule. This is the pattern,
just as our Lord, being a man of prayer, is the one
pattern for us after whom to copy. Prayer fashions
the pattern of a religious life. Prayer is the
measure. Prayer molds the life.</p>

<p>The vague, indefinite, popular view of religion
has no prayer in it. In its programme, prayer is
entirely left out or put so low down and made so
insignificant, that it hardly is worth mentioning.
Man’s standard of religion has no prayer about it.</p>

<p>It is God’s standard at which we are to aim, not
man’s. It is not the opinions of men, not what they
say, but what the Scriptures say. Loose notions of
religion grow out of low notions of prayer. Prayerlessness
begets loose, cloudy and indefinite views
of what religion is. Aimless living and prayerlessness
go hand in hand. Prayer sets something definite
in the mind. Prayer seeks after something
specific. The more definite our views as to the
nature and need of prayer, the more definite will be
our views of Christian experience and right living,
and the less vague our views of religion. A low
standard of religion lives hard by a low standard
of praying.</p>

<p>Everything in a religious life depends upon being
definite. The definiteness of our religious experiences
and of our living will depend upon the definiteness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
of our views of what religion is and of the
things of which it consists.</p>

<p>The Scriptures ever set before us the one standard
of full consecration to God. This is the Divine
rule. This is the human side of this standard. The
sacrifice acceptable to God must be a complete one,
entire, a whole burnt offering. This is the measure
laid down in God’s Word. Nothing less than this
can be pleasing to God. Nothing half-hearted can
please Him. “A living sacrifice,” holy, and perfect
in all its parts, is the measurement of our service to
God. A full renunciation of self, a free recognition
of God’s right to us, and a sincere offering
of all to Him—this is the Divine requirement.
Nothing indefinite in that. Nothing is in that
which is governed by the opinions of others or
affected by how men live about us.</p>

<p>And while a life of prayer is embraced in such
a full consecration, at the same time prayer leads
up to the point where a complete consecration is
made to God. Consecration is but the silent expression
of prayer. And the highest religious
standard is the measure of prayer and self-dedication
to God. The prayer-life and the consecrated
life are partners in religion. They are so
closely allied they are never separated. The prayer
life is the direct fruit of entire consecration to God.
Prayer is the natural outflow of a really consecrated
life. The measure of consecration is the measure
of real prayer. No consecration is pleasing to God<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
which is not perfect in all its parts, just as no burnt
offering of a Jew was ever acceptable to God unless
it was a “whole burnt offering.” And a consecration
of this sort, after this Divine measurement, has
in it as a basic principle, the business of praying.
Consecration is made to God. Prayer has to do
with God. Consecration is putting one’s self entirely
at the disposal of God. And God wants and
commands all His consecrated ones to be praying
ones. This is the one definite standard at which
we must aim. Lower than this we cannot afford
to seek.</p>

<p>A Scriptural standard of religion includes a clear
religious experience. Religion is nothing if not experimental.
Religion appeals to the inner consciousness.
It is an experience if anything at all,
and an experience in addition to a religious life.
There is the internal part of religion as well as the
external. Not only are we to “work out our salvation
with fear and trembling,” but “it is God that
worketh in us to will and do of His good pleasure.”
There is a “good work in you,” as well as a life
outside to be lived. The new birth is a definite
Christian experience, proved by infallible marks,
appealing to the inner consciousness. The witness
of the Spirit is not an indefinite, vague something,
but is a definite, clear inward assurance given by the
Holy Spirit that we are the children of God. In
fact everything belonging to religious experience is
clear and definite, bringing conscious joy, peace and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
love. And this is the Divine standard of religion,
a standard attained by earnest, constant prayer, and
a religious experience kept alive and enlarged by
the same means of prayer.</p>

<p>An end to be gained, to which effort is to be directed,
is important in every pursuit in order to give
unity, energy and steadiness to it. In the Christian
life, such an end is all important. Without a high
standard before us to be gained, for which we are
earnestly seeking, lassitude will unnerve effort, and
past experience will taint or exhale into mere sentiment,
or be hardened into cold, loveless principle.</p>

<p>We must go on. “Therefore, leaving the principles
of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto
perfection.” The present ground we occupy must
be held by making advances, and all the future must
be covered and brightened by it. In religion, we
must not only go on. We must know where we are
going to. This is all important. It is essential that
in going on in religious experience, we have something
definite in view, and strike out for that one
point. To ever go on and not to know to which
place we are going, is altogether too vague and indefinite,
and is like a man who starts out on a journey
and does not have any destination in view. It
is important that we lose not sight of the starting
point in a religious life, and that we measure the
steps already trod. But it is likewise necessary that
the end be kept in view and that the steps necessary
to reach the standard be always in the eye.</p>

knees, and set Jesus Christ out of it before you. Are you
like David in the sixty-third Psalm? Is your soul thirsting
for God, and is your flesh longing for God in a dry and
thirsty land where no water is? Then set Jesus at the well
of Samaria before the eyes of your thirsty heart. And, again
set Him before your heart when He stood on the last day,
that great day of the feast, and cried, saying, ‘If any man
thirst let him come to me and drink.’ Or, are you like David
after the matter of Uriah? ‘For, day and night, thy hand
was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drouth
of summer.’ Then set Him before you who says: ‘I am not
come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. They
that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.’…
Or are you the unhappy father of a prodigal son?
Then, set your Father in heaven always before you: and set

—<span class="smcap">Dr. Alexander Whyte.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p class="p2 drop-cap">W<span class="smcap">e</span> speak here more particularly of spiritual
compassion, that which is born in a renewed
heart, and which finds hospitality
there. This compassion has in it the quality of
mercy, is of the nature of pity, and moves the soul
with tenderness of feeling for others. Compassion
is moved at the sight of sin, sorrow and suffering.
It stands at the other extreme to indifference of
spirit to the wants and woes of others, and is far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
removed from insensibility and hardness of heart,
in the midst of want and trouble and wretchedness.
Compassion stands besides sympathy for others, is
interested in them, and is concerned about them.</p>

<p>That which excites and develops compassion and
puts it to work, is the sight of multitudes in want
and distress, and helpless to relieve themselves.
Helplessness especially appeals to compassion.
Compassion is silent but does not remain secluded.
It goes out at the sight of trouble, sin and need.
Compassion runs out in earnest prayer, first of all,
for those for whom it feels, and has a sympathy for
them. Prayer for others is born of a sympathetic
heart. Prayer is natural and almost spontaneous
when compassion is begotten in the heart. Prayer
belongs to the compassionate man.</p>

<p>There is a certain compassion which belongs to
the natural man, which expends its force in simple
gifts to those in need, not to be despised. But spiritual
compassion, the kind born in a renewed heart,
which is Christly in its nature, is deeper, broader
and more prayerlike. Christly compassion always
moves to prayer. This sort of compassion goes
beyond the relief of mere bodily wants, and saying,
“Be ye warmed—be ye clothed.” It reaches deeper
down and goes much farther.</p>

<p>Compassion is not blind. Rather we should say,
that compassion is not born of blindness. He who
has compassion of soul has eyes, first of all, to see
the things which excite compassion. He who has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
no eyes to see the exceeding sinfulness of sin, the
wants and woes of humanity, will never have compassion
for humanity. It is written of our Lord
that “when he saw the multitudes, he was moved
with compassion on them.” First, seeing the multitudes,
with their hunger, their woes and their helpless
condition, then compassion. Then prayer for
the multitudes. Hard is he, and far from being
Christlike, who sees the multitudes, and is unmoved
at the sight of their sad state, their unhappiness
and their peril. He has no heart of prayer
for men.</p>

<p>Compassion may not always move men, but is
always moved <em>toward</em> men. Compassion may not
always turn men to God, but it will, and does, turn
God to man. And where it is most helpless to
relieve the needs of others, it can at least break out
into prayer to God for others. Compassion is never
indifferent, selfish, and forgetful of others. Compassion
has alone to do with others. The fact
that the multitudes were as sheep having no shepherd,
was the one thing which appealed to our
Lord’s compassionate nature. Then their hunger
moved Him, and the sight of the sufferings and
diseases of these multitudes stirred the pity of
His heart.</p>

</div>

<p>But compassion has not alone to do with the body
and its disabilities and needs. The soul’s distressing
state, its needs and danger all appeal to compassion.
The highest state of grace is known by the
infallible mark of compassion for poor sinners.
This sort of compassion belongs to grace, and sees
not alone the bodies of men, but their immortal
spirits, soiled by sin, unhappy in their condition
without God, and in imminent peril of being forever
lost. When compassion beholds this sight of
dying men hurrying to the bar of God, then it is
that it breaks out into intercessions for sinful men.
Then it is that compassion speaks out after this
fashion:</p>

giving the reason why sinners are not consumed

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“It is of the Lord’s mercies we are not consumed,
because his compassions fail not.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
And it is this Divine quality in us which makes
us so much like God. So we find the Psalmist describing
the righteous man who is pronounced
blessed by God: “He is gracious and full of compassion,
and righteous.”</p>

<p>And as giving great encouragement to penitent
praying sinners, the Psalmist thus records some of
the striking attributes of the Divine character:
“The Lord is gracious and full of compassion,
slow to anger, and of great mercy.”</p>

<p>It is no wonder, then, that we find it recorded
several times of our Lord while on earth that “he
was moved with compassion.” Can any one doubt
that His compassion moved Him to pray for those
suffering, sorrowing ones who came across His
pathway?</p>

<p>Paul was wonderfully interested in the religious
welfare of his Jewish brethren, was concerned over
them, and his heart was strangely warmed with
tender compassion for their salvation, even though
mistreated and sorely persecuted by them. In writing
to the Romans, we hear him thus express
himself:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience
also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost, that I
have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my
heart; for I could wish that myself were accursed for
my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh.”</p>
</div>

<p>What marvellous compassion is here described<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
for Paul’s own nation! What wonder that a little
later on he records his desire and prayer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for
Israel is that they might be saved.”</p>
</div>

<p>We have an interesting case in Matthew which
gives us an account of what excited so largely the
compassion of our Lord at one time:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved
with compassion on them, because they fainted, and
were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.
Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is
plenteous, but the labourers are few. Pray ye therefore
the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth
labourers into his harvest.”</p>
</div>

<p>It seems from parallel statements that our Lord
had called His disciples aside to rest awhile, exhausted
as He and they were by the excessive drafts
on them, by the ceaseless contact with the persons
who were ever coming and going, and by their exhaustive
toil in ministering to the immense multitudes.
But the multitudes precede Him, and instead
of finding wilderness-solitude, quiet and repose, He
finds great multitudes eager to see and hear, and to
be healed. His compassions are moved. The ripened
harvests need labourers. He did not call these
labourers at once, by sovereign authority, but
charges the disciples to betake themselves to God in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
prayer, asking Him to send forth labourers into His
harvest.</p>

<p>Here is the urgency of prayer enforced by the
compassions of our Lord. It is prayer born of
compassion for perishing humanity. Prayer is
pressed on the Church for labourers to be sent into
the harvest of the Lord. The harvest will go to
waste and perish without the labourers, while the
labourers must be God-chosen, God-sent, and God-commissioned.
But God does not send these labourers
into His harvest without prayer. The
failure of the labourers is owing to the failure of
prayer. The scarcity of labourers in the harvest is
due to the fact that the Church fails to pray for
labourers according to His command.</p>

<p>The ingathering of the harvests of earth for the
granaries of heaven is dependent on the prayers of
God’s people. Prayer secures the labourers sufficient
in quantity and in quality for all the needs of
the harvest. God’s chosen labourers, God’s endowed
labourers, and God’s thrust-forth labourers,
are the only ones who will truly go, filled with
Christly compassion and endued with Christly
power, whose going will avail, and these are secured
by prayer. Christ’s people on their knees with
Christ’s compassion in their hearts for dying men
and for needy souls, exposed to eternal peril, is the
pledge of labourers in numbers and character to
meet the wants of earth and the purposes of
heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
God is sovereign of the earth and of heaven, and
the choice of labourers in His harvest He delegates
to no one else. Prayer honours Him as sovereign
and moves Him to His wise and holy selection.
We will have to put prayer to the front ere the fields
of paganism will be successfully tilled for Christ.
God knows His men, and He likewise knows full
well His work. Prayer gets God to send forth the
best men and the most fit men and the men best
qualified to work in the harvest. Moving the
missionary cause by forces this side of God has
been its bane, its weakness and its failure. Compassion
for the world of sinners, fallen in Adam,
but redeemed in Christ will move the Church to
pray for them and stir the Church to pray the
Lord of the harvest to send forth labourers into
the harvest.</p>

<p>What a comfort and what hope there is to fill our
breasts when we think of one in Heaven who ever
liveth to intercede for us, because “His compassion
fails not!” Above everything else, we have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
compassionate Saviour, one “who can have compassion
on the ignorant, and on them who are out
of the way, for that he himself is compassed about
with infirmity.” The compassion of our Lord well
fits Him for being the Great High Priest of Adam’s
fallen, lost and helpless race.</p>

<p>And if He is filled with such compassion that it
moves Him at the Father’s right hand to intercede
for us, then by every token we should have the
same compassion on the ignorant and those out of
the way, exposed to Divine wrath, as would move
us to pray for them. Just in so far as we are compassionate
will we be prayerful for others. Compassion
does not expend its force in simply saying,
“Be ye warmed; be ye clothed,” but drives us to
our knees in prayer for those who need Christ and
His grace.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Jesus Christ was altogether man. While He was
the Divine Son of God yet at the same time, He was
the human Son of God. Christ had a pre-eminently
human side, and, here, compassion reigned. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
was tempted in all points as we are, yet without sin.
At one time how the flesh seems to have weakened
under the fearful strain upon Him, and how He
must have inwardly shrunk under the pain and pull!
Looking up to heaven, He prays, “Father, save me
from this hour.” How the spirit nerves and holds—“but
for this cause came I to this hour.” Only
he can solve this mystery who has followed His
Lord in straits and gloom and pain, and realised
that the “spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.”</p>

<p>All this but fitted our Lord to be a compassionate
Saviour. It is no sin to feel the pain and realise the
darkness on the path into which God leads. It is
only human to cry out against the pain, the terror,
and desolation of that hour. It is Divine to cry out
to God in that hour, even while shrinking and sinking
down, “For this cause came I unto this hour.”
Shall I fail through the weakness of the flesh? No.
“Father, glorify thy name.” How strong it makes
us, and how true, to have one pole star to guide us
to the glory of God!</p>

<h4>CONCERTED PRAYER
</h4>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“A tourist, in climbing an Alpine summit, finds himself
tied by a strong rope to his trusty guide, and to three of his
fellow-tourists. As they skirt a perilous precipice he cannot
pray, ‘Lord, hold up <em>my</em> goings in a safe path, that <em>my</em> footsteps
slip not, but as to my guide and companions, they must
look out for themselves.’ The only proper prayer in such a
case is, ‘Lord, hold up <em>our</em> goings in a safe path; for if one
slips all of us may perish.’”—<span class="smcap">H. Clay Trumbull.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="p2 drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> pious Quesnel says that “God is found
in union and agreement. Nothing is more
efficacious than this in prayer.”</p>

<p>Intercessions combine with prayers and supplications.
The word does not mean necessarily
prayer in relation to others. It means a coming
together, a falling in with a most intimate friend
for free, unrestrained communion. It implies
prayer, free, familiar and bold.</p>

<p>Our Lord deals with this question of the concert
of prayer in the eighteenth chapter of Matthew.
He deals with the benefit and energy resulting from
the aggregation of prayer forces. The prayer principle
and the prayer promise will be best understood
in the connection in which it was made by our
Lord:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
“Moreover, if thy brother shall trespass against
thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him
alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy
brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with
thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or
three witnesses, every word may be established.</p>

<p>“And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto
the church; but if he neglect to hear the church, let
him be unto thee as an heathen and a publican.</p>

<p>“Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind
on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever ye
shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven. Again
I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth
as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be
done for them of my Father which is in heaven. For
where two or three are gathered together in my name,
there am I in the midst of them.”</p>
</div>

<p>This represents the Church in prayer to enforce
discipline in order that its members who have been
overtaken by faults, may yield readily to the disciplinary
process. In addition, it is the Church called
together in a concert of prayer in order to repair
the waste and friction ensuing upon the cutting off
of a Church offender. This last direction as to a
concert of prayer is that the whole matter may be
referred to Almighty God for His approval and
ratification.</p>

<p>All this means that the main, the concluding and
the all powerful agency in the Church is prayer,
whether it be, as we have seen in Matthew, 9th chapter,
to thrust out labourers into God’s earthly harvest
fields, or to exclude from the Church a violator<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
of unity, law and order, who will neither listen to
his brethren nor repent and confess his fault.</p>

<p>It means that Church discipline, now a lost art
in the modern Church, must go hand in hand with
prayer, and that the Church which has no disposition
to separate wrong doers from the Church, and
which has no excommunication spirit for incorrigible
offenders against law and order, will have no
communication with God. Church purity must precede
the Church’s prayers. The unity of discipline
in the Church precedes the unity of prayers by the
Church.</p>

<p>Let it be noted with emphasis that a Church
which is careless of discipline will be careless in
praying. A Church which tolerates evil doers in
its communion, will cease to pray, will cease to pray
with agreement, and will cease to be a Church gathered
together in prayer in Christ’s name.</p>

<p>This matter of Church discipline is an important
one in the Scriptures. The need of watchfulness
over the lives of its members belongs to the Church
of God. The Church is an organization for mutual
help, and it is charged with the watch care of all
of its members. Disorderly conduct cannot be
passed by unnoticed. The course of procedure in
such cases is clearly given in the eighteenth chapter
of Matthew, which has been heretofore referred to.
Furthermore, Paul, in Galatians 6:1, gives explicit
directions as to those who fall into sin in the
Church:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
<p>“Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye
which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit
of meekness, considering thyself lest thou also be
tempted.”</p>
</div>

<p>The work of the Church is not alone to seek
members but it is to watch over and guard them
after they have entered the Church. And if any
are overtaken by sin, they must be sought out, and
if they cannot be cured of their faults, then excision
must take place. This is the doctrine our
Lord lays down.</p>

<p>It is somewhat striking that the Church at
Ephesus, (Rev. 2) though it had left its first love,
and had sadly declined in vital godliness and in
those things which make up spiritual life, yet it
receives credit for this good quality: “Thou canst
not bear them that are evil.”</p>

<p>While the Church at Pergamos was admonished
because it had there among its membership those
who taught such hurtful doctrines that were a
stumbling-block to others. And not so much that
such characters were in the Church, but that they
were tolerated. The impression is that the Church
leaders were blind to the presence of such hurtful
characters, and hence were indisposed to administer
discipline. This indisposition was an unfailing
sign of prayerlessness in the membership. There
was no union of prayer effort looking to cleansing
the Church and keeping it clean.</p>

<p>This disciplinary idea stands out prominently in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
the Apostle Paul’s writings to the Churches. The
Church at Corinth had a notorious case of fornication
where a man had married his step-mother, and
this Church had been careless about this iniquity.
Paul rather sharply reproved this Church and gave
explicit command to this effect: “Therefore put
away from among yourselves that wicked person.”
Here was concert of action on the part of praying
people demanded by Paul.</p>

<p>As good a Church as that at Thessalonica needed
instruction and caution on this matter of looking
after disorderly persons. So we hear Paul saying
unto them:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Now we command you, brethren, in the name of
our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves
from every brother that walketh disorderly.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mark you. It is not the mere presence of disorderly
persons in a Church which merits the displeasure
of God. It is when they are tolerated
under the mistaken plea of “bearing with them,”
and no steps are taken either to cure them of their
evil practices or exclude them from the fellowship
of the Church. And this glaring neglect on the part
of the Church of its wayward members, is but a sad
sign of a lack of praying, for a praying Church,
given to mutual praying, agreement praying, is keen
to discern when a brother is overtaken in a fault,
and seeks either to restore him, or to cut him off
if he be incorrigible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
Much of this dates back to the lack of spiritual
vision on the part of Church leaders. The Lord by
the mouth of the Prophet Isaiah once asked the very
pertinent, suggestive question, “And who is blind
but my servant?” This blindness in leadership in
the Church is no more patent than in this question
of seeing evil doers in the Church, in caring for
them, and when the effort to restore them fails, to
withdraw fellowship from them, and let them be
“as a heathen man and a publican.” The truth is
there is such a lust for members in the Church in
these modern times, that the officials and preachers
have entirely lost sight of the members who have
violated baptismal covenants, and who are living in
open disregard of God’s Word. The idea now is
<em>quantity</em> in membership, <em>not quality</em>. The purity
of the Church is put in the background in the craze
to secure numbers, and to pad the Church rolls and
make large figures in statistical columns. Prayer,
much prayer, mutual prayer, would bring the
Church back to Scriptural standards, and would
purge the Church of many wrongdoers, while it
might cure not a few of their evil lives.</p>

<p>Prayer and Church discipline are not new revelations
of the Christian dispensation. These two
things had a high place in the Jewish Church. Instances
are too numerous to mention all of them.
Ezra is a case in point. When he returned from the
captivity, he found a sad and distressing condition
of things among the Lord’s people who were left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
in the land. They had not separated themselves
from the surrounding heathen people, and had
intermarried with them, contrary to Divine commands.
And those high in the Church were involved,
the priests and the Levites with others.
Ezra was greatly moved at the account given him,
and rent his garments and wept and prayed. Evil
doers in the Church did not meet his approval, nor
did he shut his eyes to them nor excuse them,
neither did he compromise the situation. When he
had finished confessing the sins of the people and
his praying, the people assembled themselves before
him and joined him in a covenant agreement to put
away from them their evil doings, and wept and
prayed in company with Ezra.</p>

<p>The result was that the people thoroughly repented
of their transgressions, and Israel was reformed.
Praying and a good man, who was neither
blind nor unconcerned, did the deed.</p>

<p>Of Ezra it is written, “For he mourned because
of the transgression of them that had been carried
away.” So it is with every praying man in the
Church when he has eyes to see the transgression of
evil doers in the Church, who has a heart to grieve
over them, and who has a spirit in him so concerned
about the Church that he prays about it.</p>

<p>Blessed is that Church who has praying leaders,
who can see that which is disorderly in the Church,
who are grieved about it, and who put forth their
hands to correct the evils which harm God’s cause<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
as a weight to its progress. One point in the indictment
against those “Who are at ease in Zion,” referred
to by Amos, is that “they are not grieved for
the affliction of Joseph.” And this same indictment
could be brought against Church leaders of
modern times. They are not grieved because the
members are engulfed in a craze for worldly, carnal
things, nor when there are those in the Church
walking openly in disorder, whose lives scandalise
religion. Of course such leaders do not pray over
the matter, for praying would beget a spirit of
solicitude in them for these evil doers, and would
drive away the spirit of unconcern which possesses
them.</p>

<p>It would be well for prayerless Church leaders
and careless pastors to read the account of the ink
horn man in Ezekiel, 9th chapter, where God instructed
the prophet to send through the city certain
men who would destroy those in the city
because of the great evils found therein. But certain
persons were to be spared. These were they
who “sigh and cry for all the abominations that be
done in the midst of the city.” The man with the
ink horn was to mark every one of these sighers
and mourners so that they would escape the impending
destruction. Please note that the instructions
were that the slaying of those who did not
mourn and sigh should “Begin at my sanctuary.”</p>

<p>What a lesson for non-praying, unconcerned officials
of the modern Church! How few there are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
who “sigh and cry” for present-day abominations
in the land, and who are grieved over the desolations
of Zion! What need for “two or three to
be gathered together” in a concert of prayer over
these conditions, and in the secret place weep and
pray for the sins in Zion!</p>

<p>This concert of prayer, this agreement in praying,
taught by our Lord in the eighteenth chapter
of Matthew, finds proof and illustration elsewhere.
This was the kind of prayer which Paul referred to
in his request to his Roman brethren, recorded in
Romans 15:30:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus
Christ’s sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye
strive together with me in your prayers to God for
me; that I may be delivered from them that do not
believe in Judea.”</p>
</div>

<p>Here is unity in prayer, prayer by agreement, and
prayer which drives directly at deliverance from
unbelieving and evil men, the same kind of prayer
urged by our Lord, and the end practically the
same, deliverance from unbelieving men, that deliverance
wrought either by bringing them to repentance
or by exclusion from the Church.</p>

<p>The same idea is found in II Thessalonians 3:1:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Finally, brethren, pray for us that the word of the
Lord may have free course and be glorified, even as it
is with you; and that we may be delivered from unreasonable
and wicked men.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
Here is united prayer requested by an Apostle,
among other things, for deliverance from wicked
men, that same that the Church of God needs in this
day. By joining their prayers to his, there was the
desired end of riddance from men who were hurtful
to the Church of God and who were a hindrance to
the running of the Word of the Lord. Let us ask,
are there not in the present-day Church those who
are a positive hindrance to the on-going of the
Word of the Lord? What better course is there
than to jointly pray over the question, at the same
time using the Christ-given course of discipline
first to save them, but failing in that course, to
excise them from the body?</p>

<p>Does that seem a harsh course? Then our Lord
was guilty of harshness Himself, for He ends these
directions by saying, “But if he neglect to hear the
Church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man and
a publican.”</p>

<p>No more is this harshness than is the act of the
skilful surgeon, who sees the whole body and its
members endangered by a gangrenous limb, and
severs the limb from the body for the good of the
whole. No more was it harshness in the captain
and crew of the vessel on which Jonah was found,
when the storm arose threatening destruction to all
on board, to cast the fleeing prophet overboard.
What seems harshness is obedience to God, is for
the welfare of the Church, and is wise in the
extreme.</p>

<h4>THE UNIVERSALITY OF PRAYER
</h4>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“It takes more of the power of the Spirit to make the
farm, the home, the office, the store, the shop holy than it
does to make the Church holy. It takes more of the power
of the Spirit to make Saturday holy than to make Sunday
holy. It takes much more of the power of the Spirit to make
money for God than it does to make a talk for God. Much
more to live a great life for God than to preach a great
sermon.”—<span class="smcap">Edward M. Bounds.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="p2 drop-cap">P<span class="smcap">rayer</span> is far-reaching in its influence and
world-wide in its effects. It affects all men,
affects them everywhere, and affects them in
all things. It touches man’s interest in time and
eternity. It lays hold upon God and moves Him to
interfere in the affairs of earth. It moves the
angels to minister to men in this life. It restrains
and defeats the devil in his schemes to ruin man.
Prayer goes everywhere and lays its hand upon
everything. There is a universality in prayer.
When we talk about prayer and its work we must
use universal terms. It is individual in its application
and benefits, but it is general and world-wide
at the same time in its good influences. It blesses
man in every event of life, furnishes him help in
every emergency, and gives him comfort in every
trouble. There is no experience through which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
man is called to go but prayer is there as a helper, a
comforter and a guide.</p>

<p>When we speak of the universality of prayer, we
discover many sides to it. First, it may be remarked
that all men ought to pray. Prayer is intended
for all men, because all men need God and
need what God has and what prayer only can secure.
As men are called upon to pray everywhere, by
consequence all men must pray for men are everywhere.
Universal terms are used when men are
commanded to pray, while there is a promise in universal
terms to all who call upon God for pardon,
for mercy and for help:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“For there is no difference; for the same Lord
over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever
shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
saved.”</p>
</div>

<p>As there is no difference in the state of sin in
which men are found, and all men need the saving
grace of God which only can bless them, and as this
saving grace is obtained only in answer to prayer,
therefore all men are called on to pray because of
their very needs.</p>

<p>It is a rule of Scriptural interpretation that whenever
a command issues with no limitation, it is universal
in binding force. So the words of the Lord
in Isaiah are to the point:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Seek ye the Lord while he may be found; call ye
upon him while he is near. Let the wicked forsake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and
let him return unto the Lord, who will have mercy,
and to our God who will abundantly pardon.”</p>
</div>

<p>So that as wickedness is universal, and as pardon
is needed by all men, so all men must seek the Lord
while he may be found, and must call upon Him
while he is near. Prayer belongs to all men because
all men are redeemed in Christ. It is a privilege for
every man to pray, but it is no less a bounden duty
for them to call upon God. No sinner is debarred
from the mercy seat. All are welcomed to approach
the throne of grace with all their wants and woes,
with all their sins and burdens.</p>

 </div>
</div>

<p>Whenever a poor sinner turns his eyes to God,
no matter where he is nor what his guilt and sinfulness,
the eye of God is upon him and His ear is
opened to his prayers.</p>

<p>But men may pray everywhere, since God is accessible
in every clime and under all circumstances.
“I will therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting
up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.”</p>

<p>No locality is too distant from God on earth to
reach heaven. No place is so remote that God cannot
see and hear one who looks toward Him and
seeks His face. Oliver Holden puts into a hymn
these words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“Then, my soul, in every strait,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To Thy Father come and wait;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He will answer every prayer;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">God is present everywhere.”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>There is just this modification of the idea that
one can pray everywhere. Some places, because of
the evil business carried on there, or because of the
environments which belong there, growing out of
the place itself, the moral character of those who
carry on the business, and of those who support it,
are localities where prayer would not be in place.
We might instance the saloon, the theatre, the
opera, the card table, the dance, and other like
places of worldly amusement. Prayer is so much
out of place at such places that no one would ever
presume to pray. Prayer would be an intrusion, so
regarded by the owners, the patrons and the supporters
of such places. Furthermore those who attend
such places are not praying people. They
belong almost entirely to the prayerless crowd of
worldlings.</p>

<p>While we are to pray everywhere, it unquestionably
means that we are not to frequent places
where we cannot pray. To pray everywhere is to
pray in all legitimate places, and to attend especially
those places where prayer is welcome, and is given a
gracious hospitality. To pray everywhere is to preserve
the spirit of prayer in places of business, in
our intercourse with men, and in the privacy of the
home amid all of its domestic cares.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
The Model Prayer of our Lord, called familiarly
“The Lord’s Prayer,” is the universal prayer, because
it is peculiarly adapted to all men everywhere
in all circumstances in all times of need. It can be
put in the mouths of all people in all nations, and in
all times. It is a model of praying which needs no
amendment nor alteration for every family, people
and nation.</p>

<p>Furthermore, prayer has its universal application
in that all men are to be the subjects of
prayer. All men everywhere are to be prayed
for. Prayer must take in all of Adam’s fallen
race because all men are fallen in Adam, redeemed
in Christ, and are benefited by prayers for them.
This is Paul’s doctrine in his prayer directory in
I Timothy 2:1:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I exhort, therefore, that first of all, supplications,
prayers, intercessions and giving of thanks be made
for all men.”</p>
</div>

<p>There is strong Scriptural warrant, therefore, for
reaching out and embracing all men in our prayers,
since not only are we commanded thus to pray for
them, but the reason given is that Christ gave Himself
a ransom for all men, and all men are provisionally
beneficiaries of the atoning death of Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>But lastly, and more at length, prayer has a universal
side in that all things which concern us are to
be prayed about, while all things which are for our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
good, physical, social, intellectual, spiritual, and
eternal, are subjects of prayer. Before, however,
we consider this phase of prayer let us stop and
again look at the universal prayer for all men. As
a special class to be prayed for, we may mention
those who have control in state or who bear rule in
the Church. Prayer has mighty potencies. It
makes good rulers, and makes them better rulers.
It restrains the lawless and the despotic. Rulers
are to be prayed for. They are not out of the reach
and the control of prayer, because they are not out
of the reach and control of God. Wicked Nero was
on the throne of Rome when Paul wrote these
words to Timothy urging prayer for those in
authority.</p>

<p>Christian lips are to breathe prayers for the cruel
and infamous rulers in state as well as for the
righteous and the benign governors and princes.
Prayer is to be as far-reaching as the race, “for all
men.” Humanity is to burden our hearts as we
pray, and all men are to engage our thoughts in approaching
a throne of grace. In our praying hours,
all men must have a place. The wants and woes of
the entire race are to broaden and make tender our
sympathies, and inflame our petitions. No little
man can pray. No man with narrow views of God,
of His plan to save men, and of the universal needs
of all men, can pray effectually. It takes a broad-minded
man, who understands God and His purposes
in the atonement, to pray well. No cynic can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
pray. Prayer is the divinest philanthropy, as well
as giant-great-heartedness. Prayer comes from a
big heart, filled with thoughts about all men and
with sympathies for all men.</p>

<p>Prayer runs parallel with the will of God, “who
will have all men to be saved and to come unto the
knowledge of the truth.”</p>

<p>Prayer reaches up to heaven, and brings heaven
down to earth. Prayer has in its hands a double
blessing. It rewards him who prays, and blesses
him who is prayed for. It brings peace to warring
passions and calms warring elements. Tranquillity
is the happy fruit of true praying. There is an
inner calm which comes to him who prays and an
outer calm as well. Prayer creates “quiet and
peaceable lives in all godliness and honesty.”</p>

<p>Right praying not only makes life beautiful in
peace, but redolent in righteousness and weighty in
influence. Honesty, gravity, integrity and weight
in character are the natural and essential fruits of
prayer.</p>

<p>It is this kind of world-wide, large-hearted, unselfish
praying which pleases God well, and which is
acceptable in His sight, because it co-operates with
His will and runs in gracious streams to all men and
to each man. It is this kind of praying which the
man Christ Jesus did when on earth, and the same
kind which He is now doing at His Father’s right
hand in heaven, as our Mighty Intercessor. He is
the pattern of prayer. He is between God and man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
the one Mediator, who gave Himself a ransom for
all men, and for each man.</p>

<p>So it is that true prayer links itself to the will of
God, and runs in streams of solicitude, and compassion,
and intercession for all men. As Jesus Christ
died for every one involved in the fall, so prayer
girdles every one and gives itself for the benefit of
every one. Like our one Mediator between God
and man, he who prays stands midway between God
and man, with prayers, supplications, “and strong
cryings and tears.” Prayer holds in its grasp the
movements of the race of man, and embraces the
destinies of men for all eternity. The king and
the beggar are both affected by it. It touches
heaven and moves earth. Prayer holds earth to
heaven and brings heaven in close contact with
earth.</p>

<h4>PRAYER AND MISSIONS
</h4>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“One day, about this time, I heard an unusual bleating
amongst my few remaining goats, as if they were being killed
or tortured. I rushed to the goat-house and found myself
instantly surrounded by a band of armed men. The snare
had caught me, their weapons were raised, and I expected
the next moment to die. But God moved me to talk to them
firmly and kindly; I warned them of their sin and its punishment;
I showed them that only my love and pity led me to
remain there seeking their good, and that if they killed me
they killed their best friend. I further assured them I was
not afraid to die, for at death my Saviour would take me to
heaven and that I would be far happier than on earth; and
that my only desire to live was to make them happy by teaching
them to love Jesus Christ my Lord. I then lifted up my
hands and eyes to the heavens and prayed aloud for Jesus to
bless all my Tannese and to protect me or take me to heaven
as He saw to be for the best. One after another they slipped
away from me and Jesus restrained them again. Did ever
mother run more quickly to protect her crying child in
danger’s hour than the Lord Jesus hastens to answer believing
prayer and send help to His servants in His own good
time and way, so far as it shall be for their good and His
glory.”—<span class="smcap">John G. Paton.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="p2 drop-cap">M<span class="smcap">issions</span> mean the giving of the Gospel to
those of Adam’s fallen race who have
never heard of Christ and His atoning
death. It means the giving to others the opportunity
to hear of salvation through our Lord Jesus
Christ, and allowing others to have a chance to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
receive, and accept the blessings of the Gospel, as
we have it in Christianised lands. It means that
those who enjoy the benefits of the Gospel give
these same religious advantages and Gospel privileges
to all of mankind. Prayer has a great deal to
do with missions. Prayer is the hand-maid of missions.
The success of all real missionary effort is
dependent on prayer. The life and spirit of missions
are the life and spirit of prayer. Both prayer
and missions were born in the Divine Mind.
Prayer and missions are bosom companions.
Prayer creates and makes missions successful, while
missions lean heavily on prayer. In the seventy-second
Psalm, one which deals with the Messiah,
it is stated that “prayer shall be made for him continually.”
Prayer would be made for His coming
to save man, and prayer would be made for the
success of the plan of salvation which He would
come to set on foot.</p>

<p>The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the spirit of missions.
Our Lord Jesus Christ was Himself the first
missionary. His promise and advent composed the
first missionary movement. The missionary spirit
is not simply a phase of the Gospel, not a mere
feature of the plan of salvation, but is its very spirit
and life. The missionary movement is the Church
of Jesus Christ marching in militant array, with the
design of possessing the whole world of mankind
for Christ. Whoever is touched by the Spirit of
God is fired by the missionary spirit. An anti-missionary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
Christian is a contradiction in terms.
We might say that it would be impossible to be an
anti-missionary Christian because of the impossibility
for the Divine and human forces to put men
in such a state as not to align them with the missionary
cause. Missionary impulse is the heart-beat
of our Lord Jesus Christ, sending the vital forces
of Himself through the whole body of the Church.
The spiritual life of God’s people rises or falls with
the force of those heart-beats. When these life
forces cease, then death ensues. So that anti-missionary
Churches are dead Churches, just as
anti-missionary Christians are dead Christians.</p>

<p>The craftiest wile of Satan, if he cannot prevent
a great movement for God, is to debauch the movement.
If he can put the movement first, and the
spirit of the movement in the background, he has
materialised and thoroughly debauched the movement.
Mighty prayer only will save the movement
from being materialised, and keep the spirit of the
movement strong and controlling.</p>

<p>The key of all missionary success is prayer.
That key is in the hands of the home churches.
The trophies won by our Lord in heathen lands will
be won by praying missionaries, not by professional
workers in foreign lands. More especially
will this success be won by saintly praying in the
churches at home. The home church on her knees
fasting and praying, is the great base of spiritual
supplies, the sinews of war, and the pledge of victory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
in this dire and final conflict. Financial resources
are not the real sinews of war in this fight.
Machinery in itself carries no power to break down
heathen walls, open effectual doors and win heathen
hearts to Christ. Prayer alone can do the deed.</p>

<p>Aaron and Hur did not more surely give victory
to Israel through Moses, than a praying church
through Jesus Christ will give victory on every
battlefield in heathen lands. It is as true in foreign
fields as it is in home lands. The praying church
wins the contest. The home church has done but
a paltry thing when she has furnished the money to
establish missions and support her missionaries.
Money is important, but money without prayer is
powerless in the face of the darkness, the wretchedness
and the sin in unchristianised lands. Prayerless
giving breeds barrenness and death. Poor
praying at home is the solution of poor results in
the foreign field. Prayerless giving is the secret of
all crises in the missionary movements of the day,
and is the occasion of the accumulation of debts in
missionary boards.</p>

<p>It is all right to urge men to give of their means
to the missionary cause. But it is much more important
to urge them to give their prayers to the
movement. Foreign missions need, today, more the
power of prayer than the power of money. Prayer
can make even poverty in the missionary cause
move on amidst difficulties and hindrances. Much
money without prayer is helpless and powerless in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
the face of the utter darkness and sin and wretchedness
on the foreign field.</p>

<p>This is peculiarly a missionary age. Protestant
Christianity is stirred as it never was before in the
line of aggression in pagan lands. The missionary
movement has taken on proportions that awaken
hope, kindle enthusiasm, and which demand the attention,
if not the interest, of the coldest and the
most lifeless. Nearly every Church has caught the
contagion, and the sails of their proposed missionary
movements are spread wide to catch the favouring
breezes. Herein is the danger just now, that
the missionary movement will go ahead of the missionary
spirit. This has always been the peril of
the Church, losing the substance in the shade, losing
the spirit in the outward shell, and contenting itself
in the mere parade of the movement, putting the
force of effort in the movement and not in the
spirit.</p>

<p>The magnificence of this movement may not only
blind us to the spirit of it, but the spirit which
should give life and shape to the movement may be
lost in the wealth of the movement as the ship,
borne by favouring winds, may be lost when these
winds swell to a storm.</p>

<p>Not a few of us have heard eloquent and earnest
speeches stressing the imperative need of money for
missions where we have heard one stressing the imperative
need of prayer. All our plans and devices
drive to the one end of raising money, not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
quicken faith and promote prayer. The common
idea among Church leaders is that if we get the
money, prayer will come as a matter of course.
The very reverse is the truth. If we get the Church
at the business of praying, and thus secure the spirit
of missions, money will more than likely come as a
matter of course. Spiritual agencies and spiritual
forces never come as a matter of course. Spiritual
duties and spiritual factors, left to the “matter of
course” law, will surely fall out and die. Only
the things which are stressed live and rule in the
spiritual realm. They who give, will not necessarily
pray. Many in our churches are liberal givers who
are noted for their prayerlessness. One of the
evils of the present-day missionary movement lies
just there. Giving is entirely removed from
prayer. Prayer receives scant attention, while giving
stands out prominently. They who truly pray
will be moved to give. Praying creates the giving
spirit. The praying ones will give liberally and
self-denyingly. He who enters his closet to God,
will also open his purse to God. But perfunctory,
grudging, assessment-giving kills the very spirit of
prayer. Emphasising the material to the neglect
of the spiritual, by an inexorable law retires and
discounts the spiritual.</p>

<p>It is truly wonderful how great a part money
plays in the modern religious movements, and how
little prayer plays in them. In striking contrast
with that statement, it is marvellous how little part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
money played in primitive Christianity as a factor
in spreading the Gospel, and how wonderful part
prayer played in it.</p>

<p>The grace of giving is nowhere cultured to a
richer growth than in the closet. If all our missionary
boards and secretaryships were turned
into praying bands, until the agony of real prayer
and travail with Christ for a perishing world
came on them, real estate, bank stocks, United
States bonds would be in the market for the spreading
of Christ’s Gospel among men. If the spirit
of prayer prevailed, missionary boards whose individual
members are worth millions, would not
be staggering under a load of debt and great
Churches would not have a yearly deficit and a
yearly grumbling, grudging, and pressure to pay a
beggarly assessment to support a mere handful of
missionaries, with the additional humiliation of debating
the question of recalling some of them. The
on-going of Christ’s kingdom is locked up in the
closet of prayer by Christ Himself, and not in the
contribution box.</p>

<p>The Prophet Isaiah, looking down the centuries
with the vision of a seer, thus expresses his purpose
to continue in prayer and give God no rest till
Christ’s kingdom be established among men:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“For Zion’s sake will I not hold my peace, and for
Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest till the righteousness
thereof goeth forth as brightness, and the salvation
thereof as a lamp that burneth.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
Then, foretelling the final success of the Christian
Church, he thus speaks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and
all kings thy glory, and thou shalt be called by a new
name, which the mouth of the Lord shall name.”</p>
</div>

<p>Then the Lord, Himself, by the mouth of this
Evangelical prophet, declares as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem,
which shall never hold their peace, day nor night.
Ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not silence.
And give him no rest till he establish and till he make
Jerusalem a praise in the earth.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the margin of our Bible, it reads, “Ye that
are the Lord’s remembrancers.” The idea is, that
these praying ones are those who are the Lord’s remembrancers,
those who remind Him of what He
has promised, and who give Him no rest till God’s
Church is established in the earth.</p>

<p>And one of the leading petitions in the Lord’s
Prayer deals with this same question of the establishing
of God’s kingdom and the progress of the
Gospel in the short, pointed petition, “Thy kingdom
come,” with the added words, “Thy will be
done on earth as it is done in heaven.”</p>

<p>The missionary movement in the Apostolic
Church was born in an atmosphere of fasting and
prayer. The very movement looking to offering
the blessings of the Christian Church to the Gentiles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
was on the housetop on the occasion when Peter
went up there to pray, and God showed him His
Divine purpose to extend the privileges of the Gospel
to the Gentiles, and to break down the middle
wall of partition between Jew and Gentile.</p>

<p>But more specifically Paul and Barnabas were
definitely called and set apart to the missionary field
at Antioch when the Church there had fasted and
prayed. It was then the Holy Spirit answered from
heaven: “Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the
work whereunto I have called them.”</p>

<p>Please note this was not the call to the ministry
of Paul and Barnabas, but more particularly their
definite call to the foreign field. Paul had been
called to the ministry years before this, even at his
conversion. This was a subsequent call to a work
born of special and continued prayer in the Church
at Antioch. God calls men not only to the ministry
but to be missionaries. Missionary work is God’s
work. And it is the God-called men who are to do
it. These are the kind of missionaries which have
wrought well and successfully in the foreign field in
the past, and the same kind will do the work in the
future, or it will not be done.</p>

<p>It is praying missionaries who are needed for the
work, and it is a praying church who sends them
out, which are prophecies of the success which is
promised. The sort of religion to be exported by
missionaries is of the praying sort. The religion
to which the heathen world is to be converted is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
religion of prayer, and a religion of prayer to the
true God. The heathen world already prays to its
idols and false gods. But they are to be taught by
praying missionaries, sent out by a praying Church,
to cast away their idols and to begin to call upon
the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. No prayerless
church can transport to heathen lands a praying
religion. No prayerless missionary can bring
heathen idolaters who know not our God to their
knees in true prayer until he becomes pre-eminently
a man of prayer. As it takes praying men at
home to do God’s work, none the less does it take
praying missionaries to bring those who sit in darkness
to the light.</p>

<p>The most noted and most successful missionaries
have been pre-eminently men of prayer. David
Livingstone, William Taylor, Adoniram Judson,
Henry Martyn, and Hudson Taylor, with many
more, form a band of illustrious praying men whose
impress and influence still abide where they laboured.
No prayerless man is wanted for this job.
Above everything rise, the primary qualification
for every missionary is prayer. Let him be, above
everything else, a man of prayer. And when the
crowning day comes, and the records are made up
and read at the great judgment day, then it will
appear how well praying men wrought in the hard
fields of heathendom, and how much was due to
them in laying the foundations of Christianity in
those fields.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
The one only condition which is to give world-wide
power to this Gospel is prayer, and the spread
of this Gospel will depend on prayer. The energy
which was to give it marvelous momentum and
conquering power over all its malignant and powerful
foes is the energy of prayer.</p>

<p>The fortunes of the kingdom of Jesus Christ are
not made by the feebleness of its foes. They are
strong and bitter and have ever been strong, and
ever will be. But mighty prayer—this is the one
great spiritual force which will enable the Lord
Jesus Christ to enter into full possession of His
kingdom, and secure for Him the heathen as His
inheritance, and the uttermost part of the earth for
His possession.</p>

<p>It is prayer which will enable Him to break
His foes with a rod of iron, that will make
these foes tremble in their pride and power, who
are but frail potter’s vessels, to be broken in
pieces by one stroke of His hand. A person who
can pray is the mightiest instrument Christ has in
this world. A praying Church is stronger than all
the gates of hell.</p>

<p>God’s decree for the glory of His Son’s kingdom
is dependent on prayer for its fulfilment: “Ask of
me, and I will give thee the heathen for thy inheritance,
and the uttermost part of the earth for thy
possession.” God the Father gives nothing to His
Son only through prayer. And the reason why the
Church has not received more in the missionary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
work in which it is engaged is the lack of prayer.
“Ye have not, because ye ask not.”</p>

<p>Every dispensation foreshadowing the coming of
Christ when the world has been evangelised, at the
end of time, rests upon these constitutional provisions,
God’s decree, His promises and prayer.
However far away that day of victory by distance
or time, or remoteness of shadowy type, prayer is
the essential condition on which the dispensation
becomes strong, typical and representative. From
Abraham, the first of the nation of the Israelites,
the friend of God, down to this dispensation of the
Holy Spirit, this has been true.</p>

<p>Our Lord’s plan for securing workers in the
foreign missionary field is the same plan He set
on foot for obtaining preachers. It is by the
process of praying. It is the prayer plan as distinguished
from all man-made plans. These mission
workers are to be “sent men.” God must
send them. They are God-called, divinely moved
to this great work. They are inwardly moved to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
enter the harvest fields of the world and gather
sheaves for the heavenly garners. Men do not
choose to be missionaries any more than they
choose to be preachers. God sends out labourers
in His harvest fields in answer to the prayers of
His Church. Here is the Divine plan as set forth
by our Lord:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved
with compassion on them, because they fainted, and
were as sheep having no shepherd. Then saith he
unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but
the labourers are few. Pray ye, therefore, the Lord
of the harvest that he will send forth labourers into
his harvest.”</p>
</div>

<p>It is the business of the home church to do the
praying. It is the Lord’s business to call and send
forth the labourers. The Lord does not do the
praying. The Church does not do the calling. And
just as our Lord’s compassions were aroused by the
sight of multitudes, weary, hungry, and scattered,
exposed to evils, as sheep having no shepherd, so
whenever the Church has eyes to see the vast
multitudes of earth’s inhabitants, descendants of
Adam, weary in soul, living in darkness, and
wretched and sinful, will it be moved to compassion,
and begin to pray the Lord of the harvest to send
forth labourers into His harvest.</p>

<p>Missionaries, like ministers, are born of praying
people. A praying church begets labourers in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
harvest-field of the world. The scarcity of missionaries
argues a non-praying church. It is all
right to send trained men to the foreign field, but
first of all they must be God-sent. The sending is
the fruit of prayer. As praying men are the
occasion of sending them, so in turn the workers
must be praying men. And the prime mission of
these praying missionaries is to convert prayerless
heathen men into praying men. Prayer is the
proof of their calling, their Divine credentials, and
their work.</p>

<p>He who is not a praying man at home needs the
one fitness to become a mission worker abroad. He
who has not the spirit which moves him toward
sinners at home, will hardly have a spirit of compassion
for sinners abroad. Missionaries are not
made of men who are failures at home. He who
will be a man of prayer abroad must, before anything
else, be a man of prayer in his home church.
If he be not engaged in turning sinners away from
their prayerless ways at home, he will hardly succeed
in turning away the heathen from their prayerless
ways. In other words, it takes the same
spiritual qualifications for being a home worker as
it does for being a foreign worker.</p>

<p>God in His own way, in answer to the prayers of
His Church, calls men into His harvest-fields. Sad
will be the day when Missionary Boards and
Churches overlook that fundamental fact, and send
out their own chosen men independent of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
Is the harvest great? Are the labourers few?
Then “pray ye the Lord of the harvest to send
forth labourers into his harvest.” Oh, that a great
wave of prayer would sweep over the Church asking
God to send out a great army of labourers into
the needy harvest fields of the earth! No danger
of the Lord of the harvest sending out too many
labourers and crowding the fields. He who calls
will most certainly provide the means for supporting
those whom He calls and sends forth.</p>

<p>The one great need in the modern missionary
movement is intercessors. They were scarce in the
days of Isaiah. This was his complaint:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“And he saw that there was no man, and wondered
that there was no intercessor.”</p>
</div>

<p>So today there is great need of intercessors, first,
for the needy harvest-fields of earth, born of a
Christly compassion for the thousands without the
Gospel; and then intercessors for labourers to be
sent forth by God into the needy fields of earth.</p>
